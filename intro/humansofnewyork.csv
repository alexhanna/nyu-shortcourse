This is the guy who had the girlfriend sandwich board sign in the subway.  As I said when you asked, you may use my photograph, but please do not misquote me.  This was my pitch:  ""Goodmorning New York.  I'm sorry to bother you.  I'm not hungry.  I do not want food or money, I just need a little support.  I got dumped last week and I'm trying to give her space but I can't do nothing.  If you have any words of advice for me, a quote that resonates with you or a story about second chances, please raise your hand and I'll come to you.  I have sharpie markers and I'll stay as long as it takes.""  You may choose to include the entire quote or parts of it, but you may not make up what I said and put it in quotes.  Otherwise kindly take my photo down from the website and facebook page.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I'm from Brazil, but I was in NYC in Feb/Mar 2011 and you took a picture of me. I was passing through a severe case of depression, having suicidal thoughts because it was my dream to visit NYC but everything was going wrong. I was even homeless for three days when you saw me in that park. I don't remember where it was, but I guess it was near Brooklyn? I don't know, I was such a mess back then. I was starving, cold and simply wanting to die.

I'm back in Brazil, went to a psychiatrist, took medications, got over the depression and I'm feeling awesome. Better as I have never felt before. Then I found your card in my stuff and I could barely remember what it was, but when I entered the website, I found my photo. It's attached to this email since I can't find it anymore.

My face says it all: depression. I look at the picture and I remember how awful it was, then I get happy I got over that. Your picture makes me smile everytime I see it because of that. So I just wanted to thank you.

The woman with a frog face passes,
and there goes a group of jellyfish--

Humans here aren't human at all--
Just look at the panda and monkey hats!

Gaping mouths with red clown noses,
Shopping bags growing out like fifth arms,

Zebra legs on G'raffe torsos-
Is it an aquarium or a zoo?
Either way, they're all on display.

I'm sharing this because she really describes my personal view of HONY.  If HONY leans too far toward the ""softer"" side of New York, it's because I think so many other people/artists lean too far toward the ""harder,"" ""edgier"" side.  

==================================

Dear HONY,

Recently life has been kind of sucky, for lack of a more eloquent term to describe the terribly saddening effects that new york cynicism has on a person. don't get me wrong, i think cynics are just as beautiful as everyone else -- hell, i am one, & proud of it -- but sometimes i need reminding that there is a prettier side to the world.

because some mornings on toolong commutes to a brick prison for somewhat psychotic (read: ""academically gifted"") high school students, the only things that get through to you are the beggars & homeless people curled up on seats; coming back from poetry slams & jazz clubs at night the high from letting go of all your inhibitions for an evening is crushed by the drug addicts & a woman whose face is caked with too much makeup & the apathetic look of someone who gave up on life far too young & far too quickly. when you get out of the subway station you realize that there are too many skyscrapers & not enough sky, & wonder how such a dreary existence of a city could get to be so idealized -- the reality of new york doesn't always match up with the postcards, does it?
 
usually, i've always been able to find beauty in the strangest things: poetry lying in the train tracks, boys reading russian novels on the E train, that fountain on the corner of 53rd and lex that looks like it's trickling liquid hope. you can always find the sparkle in something if you try hard enough, but i suppose the whole being a teenage girl thing had dragged me down too much for trying to be worth it. & i guess as of late there has also just been a lack of lovely, in general -- i realize it's spring, & all, but i dunno. perhaps large amounts of lovely have migrated to, i don't know, canada. (i would be more than willing to lend some to syria, or maybe uganda; goodness knows they need it.) but then a few weeks ago i found your blog & remembered how gorgeous life & the city that never [stops trying to get laid],  sleeps can be.

i love the portraits. i love the captions. i've started checking your page every morning the way i drink my morning cup of coffee -- i think that if i went without it, i might just crash trying to get myself through the day. you wouldn't believe the amount of poetry i've written using your photos as inspiration, & i've even got the beginnings of a song coming along right now, about that picture of two guys kissing at the occupy rally the other day. your page makes me feel not alone; it's amazing how easy it is to feel secluded while surrounded by eight million (or is it nine?) other faces each day, but i've realized that our uniqueness is precisely what brings & holds everyone together.

i just thought you should know that you reminded me how addicted i am to beauty when times aren't so great (yay teenage angst!). thank you.","2012-04-07T15:42:46+0000","status",NA,"102099916530784_287595944647846",2859,199,105

The man was so gentle and sweet with her.  At one point she asked: ""Can we watch a movie later?""  He replied: ""We can watch half of one-- we started one before we came.""

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","The Approach:

First of all, accept that some people will say “no.” A few people may even act offended that you asked.  This has nothing to do with you, or what you are doing.  Do not let these people make you feel rude.  Do not let these people make you feel weird.  There is nothing wrong with politely asking another person for their photograph.  Most people will be honored.  

Accept that you are going to be nervous when you first begin stopping people.  This is completely natural.  You must keep asking until you are no longer nervous.  This takes time.  But it’s the most important step.  It doesn’t really matter how you ask.  The most important part of asking is to remain completely calm.  And you must earn this comfort.

Remember that people tend to reflect each other’s emotions-- so if you are nervous, your subjects will be nervous.  When you are calm, your subjects will be calm.  And they will allow you to take their photo.  

Normally, the only thing I say is: 
“Is there any way I can take your photograph?”  
If they hesitate, I’ll add: “You look great.”

Ask everyone.  Your best portraits will be the people you were most afraid to ask.  

Speak softly.  
Smile. 
Never approach from the rear.  
Carry a business card—it will put people at ease.  

If you are photographing a child, always ask the parent first.  I don’t even interact with a child before speaking to the parent.  

If a person wants to know why you are asking— just be honest.  I often say: “You have a great face.”  Or “Your hat matches the color of the stop sign.”

I’ll end where I began— you must accept that some people will say “no.”  Rejection is the hardest part of the process.  A few people will try to make you feel weird for asking, and it can wear you down.  Don’t let it.  It is not weird to politely ask a stranger for their photograph.  It is a respectful and beautiful thing.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Everything I've Learned About Street Portraits:

I wrote this to help people with their own Humans projects.  This is just my way of doing things-- it is by no means a rulebook.  

I will promote your Humans project as long as it follows the “spirit” of HONY.  This means street portraits, not documentary photography.  It means interacting with strangers—actually entering their lives for a few moments, and telling their story with images and words. 

As long as you do that-- and show a couple weeks of dedication, I’ll share your work with the HONY audience.  

------------------------

The Approach:

First of all, accept that some people will say “no.” A few people may even act offended that you asked.  This has nothing to do with you, or what you are doing.  Do not let these people make you feel rude.  Do not let these people make you feel weird.  There is nothing wrong with politely asking another person for their photograph.

Accept that you are going to be nervous when you first begin stopping people.  This is completely natural.  You must keep asking until you are no longer nervous.  This takes time.  But it’s the most important step. 

Because the most important part of asking for a stranger’s portrait is remaining completely calm.  People tend to reflect each other’s emotions-- so if you are nervous, your subject will be nervous.  Normally, the only thing I say is “Do you mind if I take your photo?”  A lot of times, I don’t even explain the blog until after the photo has been taken.

Speak softly.  Smile.  Never approach from the rear.  (People almost always say no if you tap them on the shoulder)  Carry a business card.  

-----------------------

The Process

Once someone has agreed to be photographed, they will probably have no problem helping you take the best possible portrait.  If they are in a hurry—snap it where they stand-- you got what you could.  But if they have a few moments, try to control as many variables as possible.

Look around.  Where is the light best?  Where’s the best backdrop?  Whenever I spot a person that I’d like to photograph, I’m immediately scanning my surroundings.  By the time I finally approach them—I almost always have an “idea” to suggest.  It normally involves walking a little bit, but people are almost always willing to go the “extra mile.”   If they’ve already agreed, why wouldn’t they want to help you take the best possible portrait?   

As you can probably tell from my portraits—in the absence of a better surrounding, I almost always prefer the middle of the street. 

Be playful and have fun.  If you act stiff and over-professional, you are going to get a stiff looking portrait.  I’ve seen street photographers setting up portraits as if they are in a studio—asking their subjects to tilt their head “just-so” or arch their back “just so.”  The final result is a “technically perfect” photo featuring a very unnatural, apprehensive looking subject.  Remember, a portrait is intended to express your subject—not your photography skills.  

Street photography is unpredictable.  Your subjects will do unexpected things.  Let these things happen.   Don’t try to “control” every part of the photo.  If a subject has an “idea” for a pose, I always jump on board.  Let go.  Some of my favorite portraits have come from the unexpected.  Let chaos work for you.

*One rule I always follow--- drop to one knee when photographing children. 
Get on their level. *

Headshots have their own power, but I prefer full body shots because they bring more of the person, as well as the city, into the photo.  Sometimes a person has a great face or haircut that will call for a close-up.  Otherwise, I prefer to feature as much of the person as possible.   Taking full-body shots also brings a lot of The City into my portrait.  When documenting the people of a city, I think context matters.    

Finally--- talk to the person, but be natural.  Don’t act like Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes.  Act like a human.  Take a quick interest.  Joke with them.   Adding even the simplest quote to a photo can lend so much humanity to an image.   If conversation doesn’t come naturally, try asking a quick question.    

Good Luck!","2012-04-17T13:47:00+0000","status",NA,"102099916530784_294794173928023",295,41,18

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Hey everyone,

Humans of New York is in danger of losing its way.  For the longest time it was a very positive place.  But lately it has  begun to show symptoms of one of humanity's worst diseases: the tendency to make sweeping judgments about people based on very small amounts of information.  

Put simply: the comment section is out of control.

I've been so excited about the site's growth.  And I'm so happy that such a large community has developed.  Ecstatic, actually.  But at its core-- HONY remains a blog of my photography.  And I have a very important responsibility to the people I photograph.  

Unfortunately, the ""right to free speech"" does not apply here.  This is not the place to further an ideology at the expense of an individual.  Despite how it may seem-- we do not know the people in these portraits.  We are in no position to judge them.  Anyone doing so will be banned.  Banned users will still be able to look the photos, but they will be unable to comment.

I have never banned someone for criticizing me.  And you may continue to do so.  But the subjects of these photos are now off limits.  Good-natured ribbing will still be allowed.  Mean-spirited slander will not be.  

This may curb some of the interesting discussions we've been having.  But we cannot continue to have these discussions at the expense of an individual.  It is unethical.  Better to put the brakes on the site's growth then to destroy the energy upon which it was founded.

I know I've made mistakes too.  I'm going to try to be even more careful moving forward.  But let's try to get back to saying nice things about strangers.  In short, let's make HONY different than the rest of the internet.

Thanks so much for your support,

It's completely natural to do this. But it's the wrong way to be.  No matter how smart you are-- you will never change a bad mood by thinking about it.  You will only magnify it.

Instead focus on your behavior.  Focus on what you can change.  Go outside.  Exercise.  Quit isolating yourself.  Interact with friends and family.  Accomplish things.  Your mind will reward you with happiness.

It is so tough to change your behavior if you are feeling depressed.  But it's the only way.  Don't say: ""I'll act differently when I feel better.""

He didn't seem to notice that cars were coming in both directions.  They began honking at him.  Some slammed on their brakes.  I waited for the man to realize his mistake and turn around, but instead he just plowed forward across four busy lanes of traffic.  It did not seem like he was making any mental calculations-- it was just full speed ahead.  

When he finally emerged on the other side, I approached him.  ""I'm just curious,"" I said.  ""Did you see those cars coming, and decide to go anyway?  Or did you just suddenly find yourself in the middle of the situation?""

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I went to the Post Office yesterday with a second batch of HONY prints, sizably larger than the first batch I'd sent the day before.  The place was full of customers, but there were only two windows open.  I tried not to make eye contact with any of the despondent customers behind me.  There was an employee helping to direct the line.  She looked at my box of envelopes and said: “This very difficult.  You make big, big trouble.”

When I finally got to an open window, the employee immediately looked at my box of envelopes and said: “I’ll be right back, I need a cigarette.”  

When she came back, an argument immediately broke out between her and a fellow employee about what to do with me.  The problem centered around the fact that all my envelopes were different weights, and therefore could not be run as a single batch.  The lady at my window-- let’s call her Tanya-- seemed to think she needed to weigh them one at a time.  The other employee was in favor of selling me a giant pile of stamps, and letting me figure it out.

Tanya stuck to her guns, and started putting the envelopes on the postal scale.  She started playing Justin Beiber’s “Baby” on her Iphone.  “This is my granddaughter’s favorite song,” she told me.  She started singing along and dancing in her seat.  

The other employee shot Tanya an angry look, left the room, and returned with the manager.  When Tanya noticed this, she began shaking her head theatrically, and exclaimed: “How’s she gonna get the manager?  There are too many Snoop Dogs in this place.”  Then Tanya turned to the manager and said:  “This isn’t a band.  Nobody asked you to orchestrate.”

“I’m telling you to sell him stamps,” he replied.
“Nobody tells me what to do,"" said Tanya, ""I’ve worked here 29 years.  You can suggest whatever you want, but nobody tells me what to do.”
“I DO tell you what to do.”
“Write me up.  I’ll help you proofread it.”  Then Tanya looked at me, “He thinks I’m afraid of a piece of paper.”
“You’re not acting like a Christian,” he said.  “I thought you were a Christian.”
“I am a Christian,” Tanya replied.  “A gangsta Christian.  Bronx-born and raised.”

The yelling continued for about 30 minutes.  Tanya kept trying to bring me into the argument, saying things like “Ain’t that right?”  I just laughed nervously.  In the end, I left with a giant pile of stamps.","2012-06-27T15:01:15+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/336424279765012/?type=3","102099916530784_336424299765010",2624,323,151

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I was walking with my roommate down Classon Ave when we started to come upon a cluster of housing projects.  Suddenly there was a rapid series of loud ""pops"" coming from about about 50 yards in front of us: *POP* *POP* *POP* *POP* *POP.*  The ""pops"" were loud, but not that loud.  I saw a group of kids scurrying inside a doorway.  I thought that maybe they'd set off some fireworks.  

""What was that?"" I asked my roommate.
""Fireworks,"" he said.
""Are you sure?""
""Yeah man, fireworks.""
""Maybe we should go another way.""
""Nah man, they were fireworks.""

I saw residents peeking out of windows.  Some came down to the street and timidly looked around.  From the looks on their faces, they didn't seem to think they'd heard fireworks.  

Suddenly a man in a suit walked up to us, he had buzzed hair and a pair of handcuffs dangling from his belt.  ""Where'd the shots come from?"" he asked.  We pointed in front of us.  We followed the cop for a few yards when a group of kids came running across the street.  ""There's a bullet in my butt,"" shouted one of the girls, ""I got shot in the butt!""

I'd always heard that gunshots sound like fireworks.

I thought I could teach French here, but I had no idea how hard it would be to get a job without papers.  The only place I could find work was a carwash.  Back in Niger, kids would wash my car for me.  Now all day long I was washing cars for other people.  I was very depressed.  But I was too embarrassed to go back home.  Then one year after I arrived, George Bush got elected and everyone was telling me that it meant very bad things for me.  They said the Republicans would make trouble for me.  So I was very scared.   

After the car wash, I became a stock boy.  Then, a delivery driver.  Five years ago, I got my papers and became a citizen, so now I'm able to work at the airport.  At nights, and on my days off, I drive a cab.  Just this year I graduated from Brooklyn College with a Masters degree in French.  I finished third in my class.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","A couple weeks ago, I posted this photo with this caption:

""He barely spoke any English. But I did gather that he'd recently moved from Cuba, and had come to America for ""La Libertad.""

After seeing the post, the man sought the services of a translator in order to fully express his story.  Here is the version that showed up my inbox today:

""This is my story and it’s real. I was born in the humble town of Central Guatemala on the Island of Cuba after Castro's revolutionary triumph. I have been living in exile in the USA for the past 3 years. I come from a very beautiful and united family. I miss and love my family immensely. I never stop thinking about them, not even for an instant. Despite living here in America I still worry about their well-being and day-to-day necessities.

My mother, who is the most precious person in my world, is battling cancer.  Not being able to see her face-to-face and tell her how much I love her deeply hurts me. Due to Castro's cruel dictatorship, however, living in America means that my entry into Cuba is not permitted. As such, it’s not possible for me to see my mother, to hug her, and to tell her how much I miss her. I am afraid that I may never see my mother again.

Being a professional sportsman gave me the opportunity to represent Cuba in a workshop in Venezuela named ‘Barrio Adentro Deportivo’, which is one of the methods used by the Cuban regime to portray Castro's dictatorship as benevolent. Many of us are ‘selected’ to go abroad using coercion, deceit and threats. If you refuse to go, the regime degrades your economic and social status. Some Cubans opt to follow this charade and use it as a means to improve their social and financial status. Others, like me, decide to use it as a gateway and potential escape to a better life.

Migrating to a new country has been a very difficult experience, as it has been for many other Cubans who, like me, made the decision to leave Cuba to be embraced by this and other nations. These adopting countries have given many of us their support and solidarity because they are aware of the suffering we have experienced in leaving behind our families, friends, culture and, often, our hearts. Many of us have risked our lives fleeing through the borders of several nations in search of liberty. It is shameful and painful, but nevertheless true, that many Cubans have to face such calamities in order to achieve a right that The Creator has given to all humanity: the right to freedom.""","2012-07-27T19:19:48+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/347699925304114/?type=3","102099916530784_347699945304112",8109,343,621

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I stumbled upon a National Treasure yesterday.

I was walking down 3rd Avenue when I noticed an old man in a wheelchair.  He was being pushed by a caretaker.  Despite his physical condition, he had dressed with extreme care.  He wore an outlandish yellow outfit.  Everything about him was yellow, from his shades to his socks.  Intrigued by his appearance, I bent down and asked for a photograph.  He silently nodded approval.

After I'd taken his photograph, his caretaker offered a formal introduction: ""This is Banana George,"" she said, ""the world's oldest barefoot waterskier.  He's 97 now.  When he was 92, he set the world record for the oldest person to waterski barefoot.""  

Banana George didn't even begin waterskiing until he was 40.  But it soon became his passion.  So much so that he began doing shows at Cypress Gardens-- hopping jumps and riding with women on his shoulders.  In the course of his career, he's broken his back 4 times.  He's also broken his ankle, knee, and eleven ribs.  Banana George waterskied until the last possible moment.  I've seen footage of a very old George being pulled through the water in a wheelchair-on-skis, smiling like a madman.

Here you can see a short video I found of Banana George skiing on his 90th birthday:  http://bit.ly/ri0bD3

Banana George is a testament to loving life, and he deserves to be celebrated.  I discovered that his family set up a fan page for him.  It only has 835 people so far.  Let's show George how much we love his spirit, and join his fan group: http://on.fb.me/P0f087

If you think Banana George deserves to be known, please SHARE this story.  And in the words of Banana George: ""Don't wait for the next thing, make the next thing happen!""","2012-07-28T16:31:25+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/347974908609949/?type=3","102099916530784_347974921943281",258169,6018,51428

I noticed a man with an elaborate gold ring, and questioned him about it's origin.  ""It's from Ghana,"" he said.

""About 200 years,"" he answered.  Excited by this discovery, I asked him if I could photograph the ring.  That picture can be found in the top left corner of this post.  

The man got off at the next stop.  Shortly after he left the car, I recognized another man who I had met a few weeks earlier.  I knew that he collected and dealt in African artwork.

I want to nominate my Uncle Naldo for a portrait.  His father left when he was four and he became the man of the house. A Vietnam combat veteran, he worked in warehouses and trucking until he got laid off in the late nineties. After a few years of job-searching and clinical depression, he found peace, purpose, and community working as a doorman on the Upper West Side. He buys bags of dog biscuits for the dozens of dogs from the neighborhood who jerk their walkers to his post, then sit anxiously for a treat. 

You can find him at 41 west 72nd st, where he works Thursday to Monday, from 4 to Midnight.

Dear HONY,

I just recently had an encounter that you have likewise experienced. I was approached by a polite Asian gentleman on 5th and 23rd and asked to sell my sized 14 flip flops for $165. After recounting this story to many others, I realized that you've sold your sneakers to the same man! As we have both now enjoyed the same bizarre experience, I wanted to contact you.

Today she wrote a very nice post on Humans of New York, even going so far as to say that HONY had ""stolen her heart.""

Two years ago, when I first started HONY, I remember reading some advice from Joanna.  She said: ""Talk to your audience like you'd talk to your friends.""  I really think that wisdom helped set the tone for HONY.  And it's great advice for anyone trying to get a blog off the ground. 

Joanna is certainly a master of ""being herself"" and using an authentic voice.  It's one of the reasons that her blog has developed such a massive following.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","HONY just passed 200,000 followers!  And I've got a great story for you to mark the occasion:

Dear HONY,

I needed a metro card to get to work, but my credit card was not working in any of the machines.  I went into a convenience store and asked if I could purchase anyone's food/drink in exchange for cash, and one man took me up on it.  So I got $2.25.

But when I went down to the machine, I found that I was still a quarter short.  I went into a Starbucks and asked 15 people  if I could buy their coffee.  Nobody answered.  At this point I was getting frantic.  I desperately approached a coffee cart vendor, and explained my situation.

The man smiles and says, ""Here, take a dollar.""
""Thanks,"" I told him, ""but I only need a quarter. My credit card works everywhere except the subway. But thank you.""
""Wait,"" he told me.  ""Since you have no money, take $10. You can pay me back tomorrow, or not at all. It's not a big deal.""

This guy gave me $11 even though I've never met the guy, seen him before, or bought even a coffee from the cart... and after I've been searching for 25 cents for almost an hour. 

You can find him right outside the Bowling Green 4/5 stop.  Near the Starbucks.  He works until Noon.

They put us on ships in the middle of the night.  You couldn't see anything, and they didn't tell us where we were going.  When the sun came up, we saw that we were part of a giant convoy.   There were hundreds of ships, all across the horizon: cruisers, destroyers, transport ships.  It looked just like a movie.  Turns out we were headed to Algeria.  When we hit the Straight of Gibraltar, all the ships had to come together, which made us vulnerable to air attacks.  So suddenly the sky was filled with British fighters giving us cover.  Tons of them.  When we landed, we built runways so that the Allies could supply their North African operations.  I was behind the lines because I was an engineer, but the Germans were hitting us pretty hard in North Africa.  I remember all the boys heading toward the front on tanks.  Lines and lines of them.

The woman is refusing to sign a release form until the man gets out of Rikers.

Photographer Mo Gelder needs the release because he is the front-runner in Canon's Imagin8tion contest with Ron Howard.  If he wins, a short film will be made based on the photograph.  

Currently, Mr. Gelder is fielding several interview requests.  (Understandably.  What a story, and what a photograph!  One of the best candid photos I've ever seen.)  Because of Gelder's photograph, Canon's contest is getting tons of publicity.  (HONY is getting it's fair share as well.  Thanks Mo!)  I've got to imagine that Canon is trying to figure out a way to include Mr. Gelder in their plans, with or without a release!  I'll keep everyone updated on their decision.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Yesterday Ari from Advanced Style brought 15 ""elderly"" women with him to Lincoln Center Plaza, and held a ""flash fashion show.""  The women ranged from 60 to 95 years old, and strutted down an imaginary runway while music blared from a portable radio.  It was awesome.

But the real fun began when security moved in and tried to break the whole thing up.  These ladies had long past the age of being ordered around, and weren't taking any crap.  My favorite moment involved this 95 year old woman chest-bumping a 300 lb security guard.

See the fashion show here:

I got into a conversation with Daniel, the store's owner, about the bonding abilities of these animals.  I looked at their small heads, imagined their small brains, and said: ""These things probably could care less about humans.""

In response, Daniel opened the cage of a nearby parrot.  The parrot instantly darted out, landed on Daniel's shoulder, and started frantically nuzzling against his face.

""When the Mayans cut down a tree, they pray not only to the guardians of the tree, but to the guardians of the animals that sought shelter in that tree.  Now, more than ever, we need to pray to the guardians of nature.  The Spaniards misunderstood these ceremonies and called us polytheistic.  This was a mistranslation.  But we believe that nature must be guarded.  Sixty years ago my grandmother told me that we would have to pay to drink water.  And now this is coming true.  We are buying water, and we are eating chickens that are so filled with chemicals that they are killed 20 days after they hatch.  These are not natural animals.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Today I met an NYU student named Stella.  I took a photo of her.  Afterwards, she told me about a self-portrait she recently posted on Tumblr.  So, instead of the photo I took, here is her self-portrait.  Along with the words she wrote:  

----------------------------------------

WARNING: Picture might be considered obscene because subject is not thin. And we all know that only skinny people can show their stomachs and celebrate themselves. Well I’m not going to stand for that. This is my body. Not yours. MINE. Meaning the choices I make about it, are none of your fucking business. Meaning my size, IS NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

If my big belly and fat arms and stretch marks and thick thighs offend you, then that’s okay. I’m not going to hide my body and my being to benefit your delicate sensitivities.

This picture is for the strange man at my nanny’s church who told me my belly was too big when I was five.

This picture is for my horseback riding trainer telling me I was too fat when I was nine.

This picture is for the girl from summer camp who told me I’d be really pretty if I just lost a few pounds

This picture is for all the fucking stupid advertising agents who are selling us cream to get rid of our stretch marks, a perfectly normal thing most people have (I got mine during puberty)

This picture is for the boy at the party who told me I looked like a beached whale.

This picture is for Emily from middle school, who bullied me incessantly, made mocking videos about me, sent me nasty emails, and called me “lard”. She made me feel like I didn’t deserve to exist. Just because I happened to be bigger than her. I was 12. And she continued to bully me via social media into high school.

MOST OF ALL, this picture is for me. For the girl who hated her body so much she took extreme measures to try to change it. Who cried for hours over the fact she would never be thin. Who was teased and tormented and hurt just for being who she was.

I’m so over that.

THIS IS MY BODY, DEAL WITH IT.""

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Given the unbelievable amount of attention the past post has gotten, Stella has (quite fairly) asked me to post my portrait of her, along with some context.  Hope everyone takes a second to imagine what it's like to have tens of thousands people viewing / supporting / judging / commenting on you at one time.  

About Stella:

I struggled with body image my whole life. As a young teen, I was diagnosed with Polycystic ovarian syndrome. PCOS makes it incredibly hard to lose weight, and spikes up your insulin levels which can lead to diabetes and other complications. I felt like I was just getting bigger and bigger and could do nothing to stop it. I was so awkward and uncomfortable with what I looked like that I began to self-medicate in the way most teenagers do, except it was to a scary excess. Finally, my parents intervened and when I was 15 I got the help I needed. The past 2 and a half years have essentially been a struggle to come to terms with who I am and live life in a constructive, not destructive manner.
A couple weeks ago, I started a blog, just as a way to get out my thoughts and feelings. I found the body acceptance movement online, and it was like my eyes were open for the first time. I realized that my size or weight is not something to be ashamed of, it is a part of me. Health and weight are not synonymous, and I know that to be healthy means to manage my sobriety and PCOS the best that I can. I may not ever be thin, but that's okay. It's all about progress, not perfection.
So I posted a picture of myself in my underwear with a message to all the people who'd ever bullied me about what I looked like. Amazingly, in less than a week, it got over 50,000 likes and reblogs. It's upwards of 80,000 now, and the response has been 90% positive, I would say.
Two friends of mine, Savanna and Lucy, are in the process of planning a documentary on sizeism and its effect on young girls. My dream is to go back to my middle school, where all my body image issues began, and work with young girls on the issues of self-esteem, body image, sizeism, and bullying. I want to give these girls something I never knew, which was that your body does not define who you are as a person.  To people who judge people on their size, weight, pants size or health - shame on you. No one is the authority on beauty, and everyone has a different road to trudge to happy destiny.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Let's be honest.  Most interesting thing happening on HONY right now is Stella's photo-- which in 13 hours has been seen by 2.4 million people, and has been ""liked"" by 300,000.

The events surrounding the post have only reinforced my high opinion of the 350,000 people who follow this blog.  For the first 30 minutes, before the photo went viral, the comments were almost completely positive.  After the photo went viral, HONY's gates were stormed by the ""outside internet"" and things took a turn for the worse.  This happens with every viral HONY photo. The farther a post travels beyond the HONY audience, the nastier the comment thread becomes.  In a strange way, this contrast highlights the culture of HONY.  I think this is a great group of people.  We don't make fun of people here.  So I think mean people generally get bored and move on.     

I gave Stella all the advice I could.  I've had experience with people who don't know me writing very detailed, critical assessments of my character.  But I've never experienced the sort of concentrated, unrelenting judgment (both positive and negative), that Stella is getting right now.  I told her to realize she is helping a lot of people, and to stop reading the comments. (30,000 and counting)  I hope she was able to do so.  

Stella just wrote a long post on her experience.  It's worth reading: http://bit.ly/RNsFWg","2012-10-19T16:48:41+0000","status",NA,"102099916530784_376039475803492",10018,1023,213

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","This photogenic cross of pennies was arranged near the collection bucket of a homeless man.  It makes for a moving image, but the morality of giving cash donations to the city's homeless can sometimes get tricky.  

I've seen one mother who brings her children along while she begs on the subway cars.  I've seen her 6 or 7 times, and every time she's gotten several dollars during her 3-minute trip through my subway car.  I always wonder if I'm the only passenger multiplying those dollars by 20, only to discover a giant, tax-free hourly wage. 

Yet every person who made a donation feels that they've made the moral decision.  And I'm not saying they didn't.  I'm just saying it's tricky.

--------------------------------

Some notable comments: 

Judy Scranton: I've always said that its the condition of MY heart that matters, not theirs.

Terri Roy: I've always told my children that to give is about the condition of the giver's motive and heart, not necessarily who we are giving to.

Karin Lembo: As I heard Oprah say once,"" If you can stand there and ask for money, you can stand there and say would you like fries with that? ""

Kyria Giordano: I expected better from HONY. Seeing the money that woman receives as a ""giant, tax-free wage"" and elevating that quote about McDonalds is a failure to recognize the difficult, complicated conditions of people's lives, and a step away from the kind of love and solidarity that we need. The morality issue of cash donations lies in whether it is helpful enough to those people (as opposed to more serious support, in some cases help with addiction recovery, etc.), not in whether they deserve it or get ""too much"".

Eva Suarez: I work with the homeless in this city, and if you think NYC is crawling with people willing to sacrifice their dignity like that, to make a quick buck, you're out of your mind. We might have people like that, but they work in politics and entertainment...It's easy to see someone get money ""for nothing"" and judge, but you have NO IDEA what pain these people suffer-undiagnosed mental illness, severe addiction, police harassment, threats of sexual violence/actual assault living on the street, unprotected. As for that quote from Karin Lembo-I'm sure Oprah can be flippant, she's rich. Getting a job is not always so easy, and Bloomberg/NYC has made sure homeless services in this city are his last priority. I don't always give money, but I definitely don't judge someone whose last resort is to beg from strangers. For those of you in this thread who think begging is some sort of easy way out...you should try it for a few days, then get back to me.

Jaime Criel:  I have worked for homeless shelters my whole life. There have been many many many studies that beggers make around $20 an hour. Tax free  There are so many places for people to go for help to find food, clothing, careers. Begging on the subway and street is lazy and usually supports a bad habit. Not always, of course, but usually. People make much more money panhandling than the minimum wage. If you want to actually help someone, don't give a dollar on the subway to make yourself feel better. Donate that dollar to your local homeless shelter or career guidance center.

Kimberley McGill: One last bit from me. I have a son who is schizophrenic, and today he is stable and doing well. But when he was younger he would disappear for long long periods of time. I now he's been on the streets. I have an extreme amount of gratitude to individuals who gave him money or other necessities. And extreme amount of gratitude to organizations that helped him when he had the ability to ask, which wasn't always the case. My son is alive and well today because of that generosity of spirit that gives without judgement.","2012-10-23T22:17:50+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/377712162302890/?type=3","102099916530784_377712175636222",3274,509,149

The Spell to Make Strangers Wish You ""Happy Birthday:""
Make a sign that says ""It's My Birthday,"" and hang it around your neck.

The Cuddle Inducing Spell:
Simply hang up a sign that says ""Cuddle Zone.""  Put a few soft pillows and blankets under it.

Spell to Make Objects Move Through The Air:
Make sure there is a nice person in close proximity both to you and the object you desire.  Then simply stretch your arm out toward the object and, in less than a minute, it will float magically into your hand.","2012-10-31T16:14:37+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/380771741996932/?type=3","102099916530784_380771755330264",10057,231,400

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Hey guys.  For the next ten days, I'm going to be dedicating HONY to raising money for Hurricane Sandy.  We're going to try to do this in a HONY-like way.  The blog's content will be dedicated to telling the stories of people affected by the storm.  Sandy left behind a lot of sad stories, but also some happy ones.  We're going to try to tell them all.  The good people at Tumblr have stepped in to cosponsor the fundraiser, and they are going to be promoting these stories through their channels.  We will simultaneously be holding an Indiegogo campaign.  

I'm excited to announce that 100% of proceeds will be going to relief efforts: Indiegogo is waiving fees.  Paypal is waiving fees.  Tumblr is providing goodies.  And I'm covering the cost of the photographs.  

We found a damn good charity too.  The Tunnel to Towers Foundation is a family-owned charity in Staten Island, located right in the heart of one of the worst hit areas.  They've been doing amazing work the last couple weeks, and have been endorsed by many government officials.  

I want to emphasize that this is a fundraiser, and not a print sale.  With that being said, I can assure you that it will be the last time prints will be made available for at least a year.  Perhaps much longer than that.  Let's have some fun next week... and kick some Sandy ass!

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I want kick this thing off by telling you guys a little bit about the amazing charity this campaign is supporting. Tunnel to Towers Foundation was created in 2003, by the family of Stephen Siller, who passed away on 9/11.  His picture hangs on several walls in the office.  Though he died over 10 years ago, I heard his name mentioned several times during my visit.  After visiting Tunnel to Towers, I felt it was the perfect choice for this fundraiser.  The charity is filled with good people doing good things in memory of a good man.  Here is Stephen's story:

------------------------------
On September 11th, firefighter Stephen Siller had just gotten off the late shift at Squad 1, Park Slope, Brooklyn.  He was on his way to play golf with his brothers on that bright clear day when his scanner told of the first plane hitting the Twin Towers.  When he heard the news, he called his wife Sally to tell her he would be late because he had to help those in need.  He returned to Squad 1 to get his gear, then took his final heroic steps to the World Trade Center.  When Stephen drove his truck  to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, it was already closed to traffic .  With sixty pounds of gear strapped to his back, he ran through the Tunnel, hoping  to meet up with his own company, Squad 1.  
-----------------------------

Every year, Tunnel to Towers holds a charity run to retrace Stephen's steps.  The last two weeks, they have played a major role in Hurricane Sandy relief.  Please join us in helping them with their efforts.

We've still got 2 hours to see how much money we can raise for charity in 24 hours.  There's no ""right"" amount of money to raise.  Hundreds of thousands of people were affected by the storm. Let's think about all the people we're helping.  Then let's think about that HONY fan on your Christmas list. :)

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","So Tumblr CEO, occasional model, and all-around-nice-guy David Karp has passed down word that we can ""use him in any way"" to help with the fundraiser.  So here's what we're gonna do:

NYC HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS:

Form a team of 3 to 5 people.  Wash cars, walk dogs, sell cupcakes, do what needs to be done.  Then donate as a team by the end of the fundraiser.  TOP THREE TEAMS will get 

1) A group HONY portrait, shared on the blog
2) Copies of that portrait, signed by me
3) A tour of Tumblr HQ 
4) David and I will take you out to lunch

At lunch we will discuss highly guarded secrets of the internet.  (Then when the check comes, we will all look at David awkwardly and hope he picks up the tab.)  You never know-- maybe only three teams will enter. You can win this.  If you're in middle school, and think you can take on the high schoolers, be my guest.  If you go to school nearby, and can get to New York, be my guest.

May the odds be ever in your favor.

Our minds were illuminated by the righteous scalding fire of their arguments, and we have decided to expand the contest. There will now be FIVE WINNING TEAMS:

The three top teams, dollar wise. 
The team who raises money in the most creative way. 
And the team who works the hardest.

Instead it was met by Tony.  Tony runs the foundation's Hurricane Sandy Relief Effort.  He didn't even crack a smile.  He just started grilling me with questions:
""Are you making money off this?""
""Is PayPal making money off this?""
""Is Indiegogo making money off this?""

It felt like an FBI interrogation.  He seemed to doubt everything I was telling him.  He wasn't even going to listen to our idea, or smile, until he was absolutely convinced that 100% was going to the hurricane victims.  

And that's why we are trusting Tony with our money.

With things winding down, a few important notes:

1) For those of you buying signed prints-- I've decided that instead of sending the same print to everyone, I'm going to select randomly from several of my favorites so that the circulation of your particular print will be much more limited.  I will also never sell these prints again.  I imagine there will be about 100 to 150 of each print in existence.  

2) HS/MS Students: You have until 11:59 PM on Wednesday to submit your team donation.  Remember-- you must send an accompanying email to honytumblr@gmail.com.  Include your team name, amount of donation, name donation was made under, and if desired, a description of your fundraising efforts.

I would also like to take a moment to highlight Indiegogo's contribution.  We were their 8th (out of over 100,000) most funded campaign ever--yet they decided to waive all fees.  That represents nearly $22,000 being passed on to charity. 

Before the campaign began, I met up with Indiegogo CEO Slava Rubin while he was volunteering in the Rockaways. (Pictured)  On the bus ride home, he spent an hour counseling me on the best way to run an Indiegogo campaign.  It was invaluable advice.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","A MORALITY TALE, IN THREE ACTS:

----------------------
ACT ONE:

At 4:16 PM, I received a message in the HONY inbox from a girl named Guillar that said:

Hi I think one of your interns, or so she said she was, took a picture of me and a bunch of my friends today. I would honestly love it so much if you posted the picture because its my birthday.

-----------------------

ACT TWO:

At 5:15 PM, I replied, saying: 

I'm sorry.  I don't have interns.  I have no idea who that was.

-----------------------

ACT THREE:

At 6:30 PM, I received a message from a girl named Tessa, that said:

Dear HONY,

I did something evil today.

I was out photographing and I saw this big group of high school kids being all rambunctious and awesome so I snapped a photo and once they saw me were like ""OMG ARE U HONY!?!?!"" and at first I thought it was a joke (obviously) and responded saying ""umm DUH I am his secret intern."" Soon after, however, I realized that this was not the case: their jaws dropped in awe and one by one they began introducing themselves and reaching out to shake my hand, all on their very best behavior. They also kept asking when it would be up on your page and I was like ""probably never since I am just the intern."" Then as I walked away they made me promise I'd tell them that they all love you and I began to feel like a huge asshole and wish I could go back and tell them the truth.

The only exception is the 20 self-chosen portraits, which will arrive very early in the new year.  Customized portraits, as well as Follow HONY Days, will be scheduled beginning in January.  Everyone who ordered these should have been contacted by now-- if not, be in touch.  Same goes for the HS/MS teams.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Going to a carpet shop in Iran is like going to an art gallery.  (In this case, I visited the Iran Carpet House on Dr. Fatemi Street).  The first carpet was made 2,500 years ago in Ancient Iran.  And the tradition has developed into one of the world's finest arts.  The carpets are respectfully referred to as ""pieces,"" and the finest ones bear the signature of the artist.  Some carpets take a single artist several years to weave.  The carpets are divided into two main groups: Nomadic and City.  The Nomadic carpets are made by mountainous nomadic tribesmen, contain mostly wool, and are woven completely from the imagination of the artist.  Therefore, ""there is no such thing as a mistake in a Nomadic carpet.""  City carpets are more expensive, because they contain large amounts of silk, and are painstakingly rendered from preset patterns.  The ""holy grail"" of Persian carpets is the rare nomadic carpet made of silk, not wool.  (Ideally imbued with magic flying powers)

Home too far away?  Let us know, and we'll try to find a nice home for you to share a Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa meal.  Likewise, if you are in the New York area, and have an extra place at your table, please let us know.  (And we both secretly know you can create one more spot, by pulling in that chair from the living room, and putting it between Aunt Thelma and Uncle Harold, who haven't gotten along since that incident during Easter 96.')  Toys and gadgets are great, but nothing says Christmas like sharing a meal and your home.  

So please, if you'd like to join a meal, or have a spot at your table, drop us a line: honyfortheholidays@gmail.com
If you don't have a place, please consider sharing this post with your friends.
In your email-- tell us a little bit about yourself and your situation.  And we'll match you up.  
Obviously it will be difficult to accommodate everyone, but we will do our best!
Don't worry-- everyone will be well acquainted before meeting.  The only surprise will be what's for dinner.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","This man was driving me across Tehran yesterday, when I learned that he'd lived for 8 years in America-- incidentally on the same STREET as me in Georgia. 

He first crossed into the United States from Mexico-- paying $1,500 to be transported across the border.  He wanted to go to University and be a dentist, but learned that the idea of America was much more bountiful than the reality.  He worked at a factory job for 8 years, without ever being able to get a drivers license.  He wasn't able to find a foothold in society.  After 9/11, he said things got much tougher for Middle Eastern immigrants.  ""I had a great passion for the American people,"" he said.  ""When 9/11 happened, I had no money, so instead I gave my blood.""  Five years ago he spent a night in jail for driving without a license.  He decided he was tired of being nervous all the time, and he went all out for a green card.  When he was turned down, he returned to Iran. 

His fee for a 45 minute taxi ride across Tehran was only $6.  I paid him the rate he'd have received in America, and asked for his photograph.  He was the kind of man I most admire.  The kind that realizes you get one shot at life, and risks everything to make the best of it.  I was sorry it didn't work out for him.
""It was my destiny,"" he said. He didn't sound like he believed his own words though.
""Are you married?"" I asked.
""Yes.  I met my wife when I returned to Iran.""
""Well there you go,"" I said.  

As I prepared to take his photograph, he made one request:  ""Don't photograph me with the taxi,"" he said, ""it's a low class job.""  
""It's not a low class job,"" I said.  ""It's the job of people who take huge risks so their children can be lawyers and surgeons.""","2012-12-20T18:57:40+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/399573513450088/?type=3","102099916530784_399573530116753",87984,2018,4827

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","There were a lot of uncertainties surrounding my trip to Iran.  The US Government advises against all travel to Iran, and especially warns against photography.  I travelled to Iran without knowing if I'd be able to achieve anything resembling my work in NYC.  

I knew that a lion's share of my success would hinge on one thing: my guide.  Like all Americans, I was assigned a full time guide during my travels through the country.  All I knew was that his name was Mohammad, and he was certified by the government to lead Americans. 

Who was this man?  And how was he going to respond when I told him: ""Museums are great, but instead let's walk around all day and ask strangers for their photograph.""     

Mohammad was an absolute godsend.  He not only allowed my photography, but he believed in it and became a partner in its success.  Asking strangers for photographs is an intimidating process.  But he never once refused to make an approach.  And almost always, he succeeded in securing permission.  

As a result, the collection of photographs that emerged from this trip was a collaborative effort.  I provided the eye, Mohammad provided the tongue.  Without him, none of these photos would exist, and I am so thankful for his contribution.  

I will be providing his contact info in my next post, regarding general guidelines for travel to Iran.","2012-12-23T21:27:17+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/401128319961274/?type=3","102099916530784_401128333294606",19400,766,438
"102099916530784","Humans of New York","ON TRAVEL TO IRAN:

The US Government has a lengthy travel warning for Iran.  While not advising you to ignore this warning, I do advise that you balance it with direct accounts of Americans who have recently visited the country.  These accounts are generally filled with superlatives-- the country is beautiful, the history is rich, and the people are eager to demonstrate their almost-sacred commitment to hospitality.  

Americans are especially loved.  This was noted in every travel account that I read, and I can confirm the fact.  You will be smiled at, waved at, invited to meals, and asked to deliver personal messages to Jennifer Lopez.  American music, movies, and media are thoroughly consumed by the people of Iran.  Like all countries, there are many different viewpoints, but the vast majority of people will associate you with a culture they admire and respect.  

I was by no means starry eyed.  I'm well aware of Iran's modern history and government, though my portraits pointedly contained no mention of either.  Some of the government's policies are unfortunately impossible to ignore: Israelis, for example, are not allowed to enter the country.  You cannot even enter the country if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport.*  I mention this only because it's well publicized and relevant to travel.  I'm avoiding all other critiques, because I am foremost a photographer, and these issues are well-trodden by Western media outlets.  

But I can tell you this: for two weeks I mingled with the culture, people, and scenery of Iran, with almost no interference from the government.  (A privilege admittedly denied to Iran's citizenry)   I enjoyed the advantages that a tourist receives in any country.  Like all countries, Iran has a strong economic interest in insuring its tourists enjoy themselves.  Everyone in an official capacity will be very eager that you enjoy your stay.  The unfortunate reality is that our two governments have hostile relations, so you will not be allowed to stay in Iranian homes, or go off on your own with Iranian friends.  But you will be given extensive freedom to tour the country.  

Because you are an American, you will be assigned a guide.  But this will be an unexpected blessing.  The guide is trained in tourism, and is by no means a government ""minder.""  Beyond insuring that you adhere to the guidelines mentioned above, their job is to educate you on the history and culture of Iran.  Assuming you have no interest in journalism or espionage, the guide will facilitate and expand your experience.  In all likelihood, he/she will become your friend.  My guide was Mohammad Eslami.  If you plan on travelling to Iran, I recommend contacting him: mohammadjavad_82@yahoo.com

You will need a visa.  This is most easily achieved through AITO, a tourism agency linked with the Foreign Ministry.  In all likelihood it will be approved within 2 weeks.  Your visa will need to be retrieved from the Pakistani embassy in Washington DC.  (Though I believe you can arrange for it to be shipped.)

Lastly, travel to Iran is extremely cheap right now.  It is a darkly beneficial effect of the recent currency devaluation.  In very few places can you currently see more, for less.  

I'll close with the common cliche: Iran's government is not its people.  You can greatly enjoy a country, while at the same time disagreeing with its government.  Travel is not advocacy of ideology or policy.  Travel is travel, and it's the single greatest contributor to understanding between cultures.

PERSON A works at LOCATION B.  You can find him/her on [DAY OF WEEK] at TIME D.  [Then optimally, tell a little anecdote about the person, demonstrating their personality.]

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Dear HONY,

I wanted to tell you about Alex ""Tango"" Turney.  Alex is 92 years old and one of the most amazing men I've ever met. He stays out til 3 AM dancing on Saturday nights and goes on hot air balloon rides. I started out volunteering as a friendly visitor, but now its been two years since we've met and I try and spend as much time with him as possible. His stories, his philosophy, and the love he still holds for his deceased wife make every moment with him so meaningful.

Dear HONY,

I would tell you where Mary Downing worked, but she is no longer with us. Mary lived in Brooklyn and was the most caring person I've ever met. She taught English in New Jersey and was insanely influential- she was kind, an amazing writer and teacher, she legitimately cared about her students, and she never spoke out of anger, but was always firm; she was one of the strongest people I knew, and she was always sincere.

When she was diagnosed with Cancer, she didn't stop teaching. She kept going to NJ every day and when the commute became too much because of her Chemo, she started teaching in Brooklyn again. Unfortunately, she had a relapse and passed away earlier in 2012.

This submission isn't about telling a sad story- it's so that people can see that even after going through something so strenuous, Mary continued to do what she loved- she wrote, she taught and she lived. Thank you.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I am a street photographer in New York City.  Several months ago, I was approached by a representative of DKNY who asked to purchase 300 of my photos to hang in their store windows ""around the world.""  They offered me $15,000.  A friend in the industry told me that $50 per photo was not nearly enough to receive from a company with hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.  So I asked for more money.  They said ""no.""

Today, a fan sent me a photo from a DKNY store in Bangkok.  The window is full of my photos.  These photos were used without my knowledge, and without compensation.

I don't want any money.  But please SHARE this post if you think that DKNY should donate $100,000 on my behalf to the YMCA in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.  That donation would sure help a lot of deserving kids go to summer camp.  I'll let you guys know if it happens.

----------------------------

UPDATE: DKNY RESPONSE:

Since its founding in 1989, DKNY has been inspired by and incorporated authentic New York into its imagery. For our Spring 2013 store window visuals we decided to celebrate the city that is in our name by showcasing ""Only in NYC"" images. We have immense respect for Brandon Stanton aka Humans of New York and approached him to work with us on this visual program. He declined to participate in the project. 

For the Spring 2013 windows program, we licensed and paid for photos from established photography service providers. However, it appears that inadvertently the store in Bangkok used an internal mock up containing some of Mr. Stanton's images that was intended to merely show the direction of the spring visual program. We apologize for this error and are working to ensure that only the approved artwork is used. 

DKNY has always supported the arts and we deeply regret this mistake. Accordingly, we are making a charitable donation of $25,000 to the YMCA in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn in Mr. Stanton's name.

----------------------------------

$25k will help a lot of kids at the YMCA. I know a lot of you would like to have seen the full $100k, but we are going to take them at their word that it was a mistake, and be happy that this one had a happy ending. Thanks so much for your support, everyone.","2013-02-25T14:01:37+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/432167600190679/?type=3","102099916530784_432167730190666",42839,4596,37177

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I know so many of you feel strongly on this matter, so I wanted to make one last statement.  I've read many of your comments, and I appreciate the depth of your concern.

I want to let you guys know I have over 100 letters from lawyers in my inbox.  I've been fully versed on my rights, and I've looked at the facts very closely.  I'm not letting anyone ""off the hook"" for their sake.  I'm letting them off the hook for my sake.  

I feel like the luckiest guy in the world right now.  I do what I love every day.  No amount of money would be worth taking my mind off that.  Not for a month.  Not for a week.  Not for a day.  

In ten years, I don't want to look back on this week as some sort of missed opportunity.  I'd rather remember it as that time we took something negative and used it as an excuse to send a bunch of kids to summer camp-- who otherwise would not have had the resources to go.

We've raised almost $10,000 in just a few hours, which is great.  We may need a few heroes to reach our $75,000 goal, but either way we are going to make a huge impact, and I'm thrilled about that.

$300 sponsors one child for the whole camp.

This young woman's story really highlights the personal sacrifices that you all are making to send these kids to camp.  None of you are being photographed handing over a big check.  There aren't even ""perks"" for donating.  We are raising this money purely from generosity of spirit, and I am so proud of that.  

---------------------------

Dear HONY,

I'm an undergrad student currently traveling through Southeast Asia. Just the other day, my iPhone got pickpocketed out of my backpack, and so I've been shopping for another all day today. I came back to my room telling myself just how awesome the iPhone 5 is, thinking about just how much I needed it for the extra 250 dollars it would cost me over the iPhone 4, slowly convincing myself to indulge, and then I saw your latest update on the DKNY/YMCA cause, asking your fans to go all the way, send all those kids to camp even if the multi million dollar fashion brand wouldn't. And I thought about the difference for me between an iPhone 4 and an iPhone 5, compared to the difference between a city kid who doesn't get to go an awesome, character-building summer camp for two-weeks and one who gets to. I'm so, so happy and grateful I get the chance to do something meaningful for someone else. The way one person along with the rallying of others can move such big things in order to catalyze good change is awe-inspiring and I am so grateful to be apart of it.

I wanted to tell you guys a little bit about why I chose the YMCA.  I know some of you might be scratching your heads, thinking: ""Isn't that the place people go for a cheap gym membership?""  In some communities, that may be so.

But in certain neighborhoods, the YMCA can be a refuge.  No matter what's going on in their lives, it's a place kids can go where they are supported and nourished.  It provides consistency with weekly programs and activities.  It provides role models.  It provides a source of stability-- in rare cases, the only source of stability that some kids have.  In some neighborhoods, the YMCA is an absolute cornerstone of the community.  And that's why this fundraiser is so important.  It's not just about the Bedford-Stuyvesant YMCA.  It's about building community.

Let's keep up the pace.  We're almost there.

My name is Vicki.  Having been raised in Queens, I know well how important it is to have children experience the joys of camp and spend time in a non-concrete environment.  Now, I am fortunate enough to work for a company that brings smiles to children and families every day – Feld Entertainment.

Inspired by the efforts of the HONY community, Feld Entertainment would like to invite 300 Bed-Stuy YMCA children and their families to attend the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus during Easter week (vacation) in NY.  We are performing at the new Barclay Center, which should make the logistics seamless for families.  We look forward to hosting the kids, their families, and their JOY.

As many of you already know, several months ago I was approached by the fashion label DKNY, who offered me $15,000 to purchase 300 of my photographs.  I politely refused the offer.  But earlier this week, one of my fans discovered that DKNY was using my photographs anyway-- in Asia.    (Full Story: http://thebea.st/13ijYt6) 

As atonement for this infringement, I publicly requested that DKNY donate $100,000 in my name to the YMCA in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, so that underprivileged children could attend summer camp.  DKNY responded on Monday with a $25,000 donation.

Over the next three days, my audience stepped in and raised the full $100,000 themselves.  Over 3,000 people chipped in, and raised an astonishing $103,710 in 72 hours.  (http://bit.ly/YTy4h3)

I have no interest in vilifying DKNY.  It is a company composed of thousands of good people.  The founder, Donna Karan, is highly respected around the world for both her creativity and philanthropy. 

But I would appreciate if you would SHARE this post, and lend your voice to my request that DKNY raise their donation to match the $103,710 that we raised.

""No, I'm an electrician, actually.  I just want to have as much knowledge as possible so that I can give good advice to my family and community.  I didn't really have access to much good advice when I was growing up.  People think that kids become drug dealers and gang members because of rap, or movies, or video games.  But it's actually because of bad advice.  They see criminals with money and nice things, and those are their examples of success.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Today I had the honor of speaking at the UNIS conference at the UN.  After I was finished, three students recited original poems from the stage.  One of them really blew me away:

Fluorescent Adolescence
by Ruth Bamuwamye

Overqualified yet underachieving
It's singing delightfully off key to the radio
Yet pitch perfect in the shower
It's spending a half hour in the morning
Perfecting your messy bun
It's gelling bedhead
It's lifting weights yet covering yourself up in turtlenecks
It's being a closet philosopher but blaming lackluster grades on ""not trying?""
It's tumbling,sharing, instagramming
The perpetual pursuit of cool but aloof,
hard to get,
wit,
sarcasm,
invincibility.

It's the cycle of hurting
Fixing
loving
hating
wanting
lying... and then telling the truth.
It sucks.
But perhaps when we're older
a new set of problems will cause us to miss those of adolescence.
So I guess we should learn to love the pain,
Since it's pain that allows us to live and love radically,
feel monumentally,
and smell the coffee or watch the stars, or hear the music
that we might later pass by in the rush of the real world.

For now we are poets
And activists
Astronauts
Bloggers
Writers
Photographers
Teachers
Engineers and Inventors
For now, we are what we want to be.
Some say the grass is greener on the other side but I'd disagree:
I say our grass fluorescent.","2013-03-08T19:14:52+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/437132523027520/?type=3","102099916530784_437132543027518",11312,396,1467

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Here's a rough mock-up of what the HONY book cover is going to look like.  The actual HONY book will be a little bigger, and the jacket will come all the way to the edges, but you get the idea.  I personally think it looks amazing.  Actually teared up a bit when they gave it to me.  It felt like I was holding a few years of my life in my hand.

The book is coming out in 6 months, on October 15th.  But do me a favor-- if you KNOW you'll be getting one, and can spare $20, go ahead and preorder now.  Bookstores order a long time in advance, so if we can demonstrate solid demand in these first few days, it will go a long way in determining the final success of the book.

Historically, nationwide booksellers have been a bit skeptical of both photography and city-centric books.  I know HONY is different.  You know HONY is different.  But it would help a ton if we could SHOW that HONY is different by turning in great presale numbers.  All the work I've seen so far is really exciting, and I promise that I'm working overtime to make sure it's the best $20 that you'll ever spend.  As always, thanks so much for your support, and here it is:

Hardcover (I absolutely insisted.)  
300+ beautifully designed pages.  
400 total images.  (320 of my favorites, 80 new)
Complete with stories and captions
Only $20.

This photo is part of a month-long collaboration I'm doing with Vogue.com.  Vogue's Met Gala has a punk rock theme this year, so they asked me to assemble a collection of punk-themed photos from the HONY archives.  I've thrown in a few exclusives, also.  Besides requesting ""no cigarettes"" and nixing a couple of portraits with egregious middle fingers, they were open to all sorts of personalities and let me have free reign with the selections.  They were great to work with.  We're going to be adding a photo per day until May 6th, so be sure to check back.

I pray for peace, I search for love,
I hope you hear me out cuz no one ever does;
we gotta stick together all we got is us;
we can't stop the negative unless we
spread the peace and love;

Step outside of self, step into the world; notice
how everything we do affects the future boys and girls;
hate crimes happen every damn day;
got my momz scared 
my sister can't go out to play,
because her fear is that some psycho 
feels like snatching kids today
all these damn police but people still ain't feeling safe;

Why does it take a tragedy to bring people
together; we know its bound to happen,
we should try to stay that way forever;
now this is not to say I'm better;
but at a young age I learned that birds fly together;
it's a survival tactic and I suggest we use it
let's come together, as we spread the peace

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Dealing With Negative Comments - A Primer

It's pretty amazing that HONY has become this space where hundreds of thousands of people can look at total strangers, and there are hardly any nasty, stinging insults.  In my opinion, the culture of this blog is one of the small miracles of the internet, because comment threads seem to be a slugfest almost everywhere else.  If you agree with me, here's the main thing you can do to help:

Don't respond.  It may take a few minutes, but we'll take care of the bomb throwers.  It makes our job tougher when there are twenty responses REPEATING THE INSULT, then chastising the original poster.

Avoid doing this:  ""Hey John Doe, this person is NOT A THREE EYED MONSTER.  You're an asshole!""

By negating the insult, you're only giving it power.  If you feel a burning need for vengeance, send a private message with the person's name, and let us take care of it.  Here's a little secret:  HONY has a good culture because MEAN PEOPLE GET BORED.  Don't give the assholes any stimulation by swapping energy with them.     

For the red-blooded patriots among you who love free speech-- don't worry, we aren't THAT trigger happy with the censorship.  We love funny people.  We just don't love assholes.  If you feel you've been unjustly banned, let us know.  We've ""unbanned"" plenty of people after sincere correspondence.","2013-05-08T15:46:55+0000","status",NA,"102099916530784_460197764054329",13673,627,368

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I asked her for a piece of advice.  She reached in her purse, pulled out a piece of paper, and handed it to me.  It said this:

Life isn't fair, but it's still good.  Life is too short-- enjoy it.  Cry with someone.  It's more healing than crying alone.  Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present and the future.  It's OK to let your children see you cry.
Don't compare your life to others.  You have no idea what their journey is all about.  If a relationship has to be secret, you shouldn't be in it.  
Take a deep breath, it calms the mind.  Everything can change in the blink of an eye.  It's never too late to be happy.  But it's all up to you and no one else.  When it comes time to go after what you love in life, don't take no for an answer.  Burn the nice candles, use the nice sheets, wear the nice lingerie, wear the nice clothes.  Don't save it for a special occasion.  Today is special.
Over prepare, then go with the flow.  No one is in charge of your happiness but you.  Frame every so-called disaster with these words: 'In five years will this matter?'  Always choose life.  Forgive but don't forget.  Time heals almost everything.  Give time, time.  However good or bad a situation is, it will change.  All that truly matters in the end is that you loved.
If we all threw our problems in a pile and we saw everyone else's, we'd grab our's back.  Envy is a waste of time.  Accept what you already have, not what you need.  Yield.  Friends are the family we choose.  Life isn't tied with a bow, but it's still a gift.*

After researching and testing a variety of polymers, alloys, and space-age plastics, they appear to have settled on plywood as their material-of-choice.  The blueprints can only be fully understood by a trained professional.  However, even the layman can see that the circles on the design roughly correspond to the circles heaped against the wall.  This means the body is well underway, though ""the skin will be sort of tough to figure out.""

all made up and dressed to the 9’s

Ladies and gentlemen and variations
thereupon, observe this paradox-

It's got 300 of my favorite photos and captions (out of 5,000), as well as 80 new, exclusive photos.  The design went through several drafts and came out super polished.  And everyone who's seen it, including me, thinks it looks amazing.

The book also just got this review from Publisher's Weekly.  It was a ""starred"" review, which I'm told is a good thing:

""Many photo essays of this type have a singular topic in mind, such as highlighting urban blight or homelessness. [Humans of New York] doesn’t shy away from those topics, but it doesn’t dwell either.  There’s no judgment, just observation and in many cases reverence, making for an inspiring reading and visual experience.""

""What for?""
""I run a site called Humans of New York... I've taken 5,000 street portraits of people around the city.""  He turned his computer around to face me.

He'd been looking at HONY.","2013-07-24T21:48:26+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/493889850685120/?type=3","102099916530784_493889857351786",113317,2495,2024

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Yesterday, I was walking through Washington Square Park when I noticed a small boy and his mother selling cowboy supplies.  ""We're saving up for a horse,"" they told me.  

The boy's name was Rumi.  After speaking with Rumi's mother, I learned that Rumi has loved horses his entire life.  He has horse themed shirts, toys, and backpacks.  All those things are great.  But Rumi's biggest dream is to own a horse.  ""You can get one for $1000!"" he told me.  After a full afternoon of selling cowboy supplies, he'd raised $1.  He seemed a little downtrodden by the afternoon's results, but committed to his ultimate goal.

That night, I jumped on the phone with a couple of horse experts-- not Rumi's parents-- who have special expertise regarding kids who want horses.  These horse experts-- not Rumi's parents-- told me that having a horse is super expensive.  It's just about impossible for normal parents, especially ones who live in a small NYC apartment, and who aren't wealthy, to provide a horse for their child.  Sometimes this can be quite heartbreaking.

So I thought of a plan.  Let's send Rumi on a Wild West Adventure!  With the size of the HONY audience, it'd be quite a simple thing to do.  I spent all last night making phone calls, and threw in $300 to get us started.  Please consider tossing a few coins in the [cowboy] hat:

""What was the saddest moment of your life?""

Because I loved the photo and was hoping to pair it with a great caption. When I got home, there was an email in my inbox:


Dear Brandon,

I saw you in Central Park this evening with my daughter (red head).   You asked me about my happiest day - I told you when my daughters were born (I meant it).  You asked me what the saddest day in my life was - i told you I'd rather not answer. Well, it was Aug 12, 2006 -  on that day, my wife and I lost our first baby - she was 36 weeks pregnant (his name was Peter).  It was horrible.  But now we have 2 beautiful little girls, so Im grateful.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I think this is the first time that I've ever answered a complaint publicly, but one in particular keeps popping up, and I'm only replying because I think the response illustrates an important concept. In a three-to-five minute conversation with strangers, there are certain prompts which tend to uncover the most meaningful events in a person's life. Our greatest stories tend to be coupled with a very strong emotion-- whether that be happiness, fear, or sadness. The people in these photos have been generous enough to grant me a small amount of time to learn about their lives. As a general rule, I try not to waste that time by asking about favorite foods, sports teams, or colors. 

I usually ask the same questions because I always get different answers-- and more often than not, those answers come in the form of a very meaningful story. HONY isn't about questions-- it's about people and stories. So until those stories become repetitive, let's try not worry about the questions that prompted them.","2013-08-08T15:58:25+0000","status",NA,"102099916530784_501119773295461",39222,1983,130

It was extremely cheesy-- with a giant animated GIF as the title graphic, and pretty much all content harvested straight from other sources.  The page never got any traffic, but I remember how exciting it was to build the site.  The internet seemed like a place where a 7th grader could participate in the adult world on a level playing field.  My friend and I tried one website idea after another.  None of them really worked, but we felt very empowered.  On the internet, it felt like we were one good idea away from a very adultlike level of success.  And like pretty much everyone else in 1996, our free websites were hosted on Geocities.com.

Fast forward almost 20 years--- in my late twenties, after several failed attempts, I've managed to create a popular website.  And last night I was out gathering content.  I was walking past the Apple Store on 59th and 5th when I spotted a man sitting alone in the plaza.  I asked for his photo, he agreed.  ""What was the happiest moment of your life?"" I asked him.

Yesterday I drove 2 hours north of the city, and took a tour of the New York YMCA Sleepaway Camp.  (The destination for many of the kids we supported.)  Pictured below were my tour guides-- Lexi and Emerald.  

Even though it rained during my entire tour, everybody seemed to be having a great time.  There was archery, kickball, swimming, volleyball, ceramics, painting, watersports, and hundreds of tacos.  

As told to me by the executive director, Wheaton Griffin:  ""Our goal is to provide our campers with the same camp experience available to wealthy children.  Most of our campers are here on scholarships.  But they have just as much fun as kids at expensive camps.  We don't have a lot of the fancy stuff here,"" he said.

This is Malik from Brooklyn.  Last summer, Malik's goal was to stop bullying at camp.
""How do you do that?"" I asked.
""Well, you can't stop it completely,"" he said.  ""But if you see someone getting bullied, you can ask the bully to think about how he would feel if the same thing happened to him.""

I handed one off to Anna, the 95 year old master poetess and sex joke encyclopedia who always sits on the corner.  I waited nervously for her review.

Digging
by Seamus Heaney

Between my finger and my thumb   
The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.

Under my window, a clean rasping sound   
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:   
My father, digging. I look down

Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds   
Bends low, comes up twenty years away   
Stooping in rhythm through potato drills   
Where he was digging.

The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft   
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked,
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.

By God, the old man could handle a spade.   
Just like his old man.

My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner’s bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
Over his shoulder, going down and down
For the good turf. Digging.

The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I’ve no spade to follow men like them.

Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests.
I’ll dig with it.","2013-08-31T16:22:51+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/513699518704153/?type=3","102099916530784_513699552037483",31910,1037,2829

""Haul your butt and your camera stuff to Bethesda Fountain upon the morrow, meet me around 'twixt 10 and noon, if thou wouldst have that Dragonmaster's endorsement.""

I arrived at Bethesda Fountain at the appointed time and discovered Blackwolf, accompanied by his dragon Sir Aragorn.  After verifying that his portrait was included in the book, Blackwolf agreed to cast two spells.  I laid the book at his feet, then ran to higher ground to avoid any errant wizard sparks. 

""First I will cast the Dream Your Possible Dream Spell,"" he said. ""This will impart good thoughts and dreams upon all mortals who read this book.""  He waved his staff over the book.  I didn't see any sparks but Blackwolf assured me that the spell had been cast.

""Next I will cast the Spell of Good Fortune.""
""What does that one do?"" I asked.
""It brings traffic to Blackwolf's website."" 

Though the second spell seemed to be a bit underhanded and self-serving, I didn't ask any questions.  He then asked me if I wanted him to cast a ""Make Brandon Stanton Money Spell.""  

""Do that one quick,"" I said.  ""But keep your voice down.""

Luckily there was one girl in the class who could understand him, so she would translate everything for me.  Then one day, I looked up from my desk, and noticed David reading a book on the floor.  I knew that no 6 year old with an IQ below 80 was reading a book, so I walked up to him, and without saying a word, I closed the book.  He looked up at me and screamed: 'Fuck you!'  I was so happy that he'd said something I could understand that I picked him up and kissed him.

Here's a little excerpt from a long recap of the trip that she sent me.

""He got quite good at identifying a significant number of the herd (they have 121) and would get up early to watch them come in from pasture, feed them, and would stay at the stables until late to feed them again and watch them go out at night.  Just being with the horses, feeding them, watching them, getting to know them, being treated like a regular ranch-hand by the wranglers who let him lug around buckets of feed in the mud...that really was the most soul-filling thing for him.  He is a different person for this.""

Cohiba cigars were only given to diplomats.  They were never made available for sale.  This is why they are legendary.

AMAZON: http://amzn.to/10sbtW5
BARNES AND NOBLE: http://bit.ly/16SycBf
INDIEBOUND: http://bit.ly/191EZLF

On launch day, OCTOBER 15th @ 7PM, we are going to have a celebration/signing at the Union Square Barnes and Noble.  (Known colloquially as ""that giant Barnes and Noble."")
 
Confirmed attendees include: The 15 ft tall Christopher Walken HONYsaurus Rex, Blackwolf The Dragonmaster, Ricky Syers and his marionettes, Spiderman, and Joey McDevitt, who will be telling dick jokes for $1.   Joe Mangrum has also agreed to create one of his sand painting masterpieces for the occasion.  More distinguished guests are committing every day...

I will be telling the story of HONY, which is a pretty good story if you don't mind me saying.  And if history is any indication, that means a 65% chance of man tears.  I will then be signing books and anything else you put in front of me.  (Books will of course be available in store, and everyone's preorders should have arrived by then.)  

**You do not have to purchase a book to attend.**
Feel free to just come in listen, and/or say ""hello.""
I'll hang around until they kick me out.

If you can't make it, do not fear.  I will also be doing a book signing on October 22nd at Powerhouse Arena in Brooklyn.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","This is such a cool story.  About a month ago, I posted a photo of Ricky and Doris.  At that time, all I knew was that Ricky was a puppeteer, and he had become good friends with Doris while performing in the park.  He loved her so much that he honored her by creating her own puppet.  (Top photo).  I always assumed that Doris was a woman of very few words.  Because every time I tried to speak with her, she smiled, and nodded, but never spoke back.  Ready for the kicker?

I ran into Doris a few nights ago in Washington Square Park.  And she spoke to me!  Clear as day.  In fact, she had quite a lot to say.  Turns out, she had just gotten out of surgery to fix her vocal cords.  For a full year, she had been unable to speak, because a shoulder injury had pinched a nerve in her throat.  So you know what that means?

That means that Ricky and Doris had developed this amazing friendship without Doris even being able to talk.  To make the moment even more magical, Ricky's friend was nearby that night.  He pulled out a cellphone, and gave Ricky a call.  The bottom photo shows Ricky and Doris speaking for the very first time.

All the adrenaline and appointments from the previous week, and excitement for the coming week, have really been doing a number on my sleeping habits.  But I just want to give you guys a final, behind-the-scenes wrap up of what's happened with the HONY book.

When I decided to make a book last year, nobody really wanted it.  We pitched it to all the large publishers, but only two made offers.  One publisher wanted to make an inexpensive paperback.  And just one--St. Martin's Press, a Macmillan imprint, believed in our vision of an artistic hardcover.  All the other publishers said the same thing: ""Photography books don't sell.""  And ""This sounds like a regional book."" 

And you know what?  They were right.  Photography books typically don't put up big numbers.  And Humans of New York does 'sound' like a regional book.  But what they didn't know was this-- an amazing, international community of people had gathered around this blog.  And week after week, you guys put up preorder numbers that were absolutely jaw dropping.  Just jaw dropping.

The book goes on sale tomorrow.  But you guys have already made it a success of the massive bestseller variety.  Thank you for vindicating everything I've dreamed about.  And it might be the lack of sleep, but I'm saying this with tears in my eyes, you guys have made every one of my dreams come true.  And I can't thank you enough.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Dear Brandon,

My daughters were so excited to see PomPom on HONY today and we thought you'd be interested in the back story of why this dog is sitting on an uninstalled air conditioner in a newsstand. 

We regularly take PomPom to the newsstand to reunite with her former owner.  Doyle, 76, and legally blind, lived in a building on the same block of Lexington Avenue as the newsstand for 43 years until July, when the city evicted all the residents due to unsafe conditions.  

Doyle wandered the streets with PomPom for several days before the owner of the newsstand called us to ask if we'd watch the dog because homeless shelters do not accept pets. I took Doyle to the Red Cross and NYC housing officials found him a temporary room in an SRO building across town.  He asked us to adopt PomPom.

That's how we ended up as the new family for this 11-year-old dog. She loves seeing Doyle at the newsstand.  We're thrilled you documented her pose atop the air conditioner.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","We lost a HONY All Star today.  Banana George passed away at the age of 98.  I'm so glad I had the opportunity to meet him.  Here's the post, as originally featured several months ago:

----------------------------

I stumbled upon a National Treasure yesterday.

I was walking down 3rd Avenue when I noticed an old man in a wheelchair. He was being pushed by a caretaker. Despite his physical condition, he had dressed with extreme care. He wore an outlandish yellow outfit. Everything about him was yellow, from his shades to his socks. Intrigued by his appearance, I bent down and asked for a photograph. He silently nodded approval.

After I’d taken his photograph, his caretaker offered a formal introduction: “This is Banana George,” she said, “the world’s oldest barefoot waterskier. He’s 97 now. When he was 92, he set the world record for the oldest person to waterski barefoot.” 

Banana George didn’t even begin waterskiing until he was 40. But it soon became his passion. So much so that he began doing shows at Cypress Gardens— hopping jumps and riding with women on his shoulders. In the course of his career, he’s broken his back 4 times. He’s also broken his ankle, knee, and eleven ribs. Banana George waterskied until the last possible moment. I’ve seen footage of a very old George being pulled through the water in a wheelchair-on-skis, smiling like a madman.

Here you can see a short video I found of Banana George skiing on his 90th birthday: http://bit.ly/ri0bD3","2013-10-19T01:17:46+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/539805436093561/?type=3","102099916530784_539805459426892",54102,2023,3807

Everyone was laughing, dancing, and singing, as very loud dance music blared from a portable sound system.
""This is a new type of dance party!"" someone shouted into a microphone, ""Join us!""  The participants fanned out through the station, encouraging onlookers to join them.  ""Don't just stand there!"" said the man with the microphone,  ""This works better if everyone is dancing!""

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I was riding in a van with a television crew who was doing a piece on HONY.  The cameraman, Duane, was behind the wheel.  At one point he casually remarked on how bad the traffic was in Ethiopia.
""Ethiopia?"" I asked. ""What story were you working on there?""
""It wasn't a story,"" he replied.  ""We were picking up our daughter.""

He then told me the most amazing story.  He told me that he and his wife were not able to conceive.  “But I’d always resisted the idea of adoption,” he said.  “My wife wanted to adopt right away, but I was just never sure if I’d be able to fully love a child that wasn’t my blood.”  So time went on, and they remained childless.  

Then one evening Duane was watching a television show with his wife.  The show was about aid work in Ethiopia.  “They were showing before-and-after photos,” he explained.  “I remember this one girl.  She was skin and bones.  But she still had this amazing smile and spirit in her eyes.  The aid workers rehabilitated her, and six months later, she looked like a normal little girl.  Right then, I turned to my wife, and said: ‘I’m ready to adopt.’”  

But it wasn’t as easy as he’d hoped.  “At first I thought we needed an infant,” Duane explained.  ""I just couldn't imagine missing out on all those early moments of our child's life.""  But for healthy infants, the waiting list was years.  “So then we went we moved up to three or four year olds.”  But still, the waiting list was one to two years.  “The only children you could get immediately were seven and up, and who had physical handicaps of some sort.  I just didn’t think I was ready for it.”

But then Duane and his wife went on vacation.  And toward the end of the trip, “after a few drinks,” Duane’s wife brought out a brochure from the adoption agency.  One of the pictures showed an unsmiling seven year old girl, standing against the pink wall of an orphanage.  She had been blinded in one eye.  “That’s our daughter,” Duane said.  

Three years later after the Watkins adopted her, Chaltu has blossomed.  She has grown over one foot, is fluent in English, and although blind in one eye, plays soccer, gymnastics, and basketball.  She’s doing great at school, and has tons of friends.  ""She is the greatest daughter in the world,” Duane said.

“That's an unbelievable story,” I told Duane.  “Can I share it on HONY?”

“That’s fine with me,” he answered.  Then he sort of stared at the ground for a second, shuffled his feet, and asked: “Would there be any possibility that you could help us raise the adoption fees to get her a brother?  We've already found him, but aren't financially ready yet.”

She pulled out a thick stack of charts and diagrams.  ""I've been collecting quotes from people who walk by, counting how many people read the official description, and charting where people accumulate to view it.""

I've been following him ever since, as he inspired millions with the wonders of space by combining social media and, well, OUTER SPACE.  ""Watching a shuttle launch is great,"" explains Hadfield, ""But it's more entertainment than inspiration.  For the first time, social media allowed people to come along with us, and experience space like an astronaut.""  

I had the honor of meeting Mr. Hadfield while he was in New York, doing interviews surrounding his new book, available here:  http://amzn.to/1ahDcNE

""What's the most frightened you ever felt in space?""
""Honestly, very little happened that I wasn't prepared for.  Astronauts prepare for everything.  You'd be amazed at all the things we train for.  Specialization is for insects.  Humans have to be generalists-- and astronauts especially.  Before the mission, I actually studied with a dentist in case I needed to surgically extract a tooth.  So I never felt very afraid because I'd prepared for everything.  But if I was to give an answer-- one time we were coming across the Indian Ocean, and I was looking down at Australia.  And a shooting star passed below us.  A big one.  A shooting star came between us and the world.  And I thought: 'Oh man, we really are floating around in an aluminum bubble up here.'""

I am one of the officers in this picture.  My friend found it in your book and pointed it out to me.  The victim under the sheet was a woman in her late fifties. She was Miss Austria in her early 20's and a contestant in the Miss World pageant. At the time of her death she was destitute and alone, but still carried her passport with a photo of her at the peak of her beauty. She was stunning. On October 22nd of last year, wandering the halls of the building she had chosen for her last act, she had looked for an open window at the record company that produces Maroon Five. Asked to leave, she found one a floor above in a hallway, took sleeping pills, sat on the ledge in the sunlight for about ten minutes, then leaned forward.  Anyway, thanks for the photo.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Dear Brandon,

My HONY book arrived in Pakistan today.  Though it was five months late, it was my favorite birthday present of the year.  

In a country where people fight for survival everyday, I'm one of the fortunate few whose biggest worry right now is getting through medical school. In my part of the world, people like me, no matter how much we try to deny it, live in a bubble. And our problems are called ""first world problems.""  Maybe it will surprise people to see a ""Pakistani"" so in touch with the Western World. To see something other than the hatred that the world seems to notice radiating from here.  But in my little bubble here in Pakistan, I find inspiration in the stories shared on Humans of New York, because they depict more than what the common man perceives. Yes, Pakistan as a nation suffers more than the rest, we do have a billion and one problems, but HONY reminds me that above everything else we are individuals. That just how every Pakistani is not the same, neither is every American. It reminds me to love and respect everybody-- something many people here tend to have forgotten.  The pictures and stories on HONY almost always make me feel like anything is possible. 

Thank you,
Sakina","2013-11-06T01:10:01+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/549495015124603/?type=3","102099916530784_549524821788289",87712,2233,3653

The poem is titled: 'I realized last night that, for the first time in my life, I am finally really willing to be an organ donor.'

------------------------------

Sweet sixteen One summer afternoon, about out the door for family dinner at Outback Steakhouse. Went to check on my bestie Jenie, staying with me for the summer, kicked out of her own house again, one more time.  I had a feeling. Are you sure you don't want to come with us? I said, peeking into the top bunk of my little brothers bed. No response. Motionless,  unconscious. I ran to my auntie, doctor frances, downstairs. ""She'll be okay,"" said doctor frances. We called the ambulance anyway. ""She'll be okay, ""said doctor frances, again, after they wheeled Jenie away on a stretcher. Jenie went to icu, had her stomach pumped, went to rehab after that.

We pretty much pretended nothing had happened.

Time passed. Lots of things happened.

One winter afternoon, the ripe age of 22, my mom dropped me off at a portland clinic, 10th floor of an office building. ""babies are expensive,"" my single-father boyfriend had said. i took his word for it, and took the valium and the vicodin from the nurse, listened to them read me quotes from other girls in my condition about how happy they were with their choice. I lied back on the table, sucked in the nitrous greedily as the doctor sucked out my ""unwanted growth,"" as they called it. ""youre so calm, "" the doctor said to me. They sent me to a ""recovery room""- and lying in the bed, looking at the poster of the Eiffel Tower at sunset on the wall above me, and the rainy grey oregon sunset sky out the window beyond, I knew I had just given away any good karma I had gained by saving my best friend's life 6 years before.


A January evening in Istanbul, on the couch, totally stoned on afghani hash with my second Turkish boyfriend, I picked up a phone call from old friend Melinda, now married with 2 kids in Spokane Washington. She sounded far away. I knew something was weird--we hadn't talked in years. ""Dane went back to Vegas for a few days to finish a job,"" she began. Dane, Jennie's high school crush , and new husband. ""Jenie stayed in portland, in their new house with their two dogs. When her dad went over to say hi,  check on her, he found her in the garage, in the front seat of her 4 runner. It had stopped running by then-- run out of gas.
The dogs are okay, though.""
I couldn't afford to fly back for the funeral. My little brother stood in my stead,  scattered some flowers on her casket.

And now, here I am at 31, 37 and a half weeks pregnant. Round 2.
 from march 4th onward, This new life inside me, a whole second self, spontaneously generating, it seems, organizing itself around some miracle principles. I  felt it from the very beginning, the very moment of first meiosis.
Really, like a veil dropped, or lifted, or something. I was walking across a field at a spa outside Poughkeepsie and I felt the shift. It was wild.
Life is wild. Death is something else.

So I'd like to take this opportunity to declare
I'm finally willing to be an organ donor. I never was before. but i can surely say if it comes down to it I am ready to give the pieces of me to others. Take my kidneys, take my heart, take my myopic eyes

The lines around the self, the borders between you and me aren't as obvious as they may seem

We are all connected. Some more obviously than others

So please, Take what you can from me
Bury the rest at sea, someday

It all comes back around eventually.","2013-11-16T15:18:20+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/554820667925371/?type=3","102099916530784_554820681258703",129570,3296,9213

They spoke of legendary coupon codes that would reduce the price of HONY books to $10.50.  ""Nonsense,"" I thought.  ""Those books are $15 wholesale.  No company is going to take a bath like that.""

But apparently it wasn't nonsense.  There was legit plunder to be had.  (And I learned the definition of: 'Loss Leader.')  And as word of this free plunder spread through the HONY diaspora, the pillaging commenced.  We shot to the top of the rankings on both sites.  ""I've never seen anything like this [merciless pillaging],"" said one seasoned Macmillan executive.        

ANYWAY, I wasn't planning on doing another book promo for a while.  But plunder is plunder, and plunder must be pointed out.  Until midnight tonight, there are below cost HONY books to be had.  I tested the coupon codes this morning just to be sure.  And they work.  $10.50 books.

**UPDATE: Amazon is currently cleaned out, but there is a shipment on the way from the publisher, due early next week.  You can lock in those books at current price.**

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","THE CHRISTMAS SITUATION

As many of you have already noticed, the HONY Book has been unavailable online all week.  During the last three days of November, we basically sold our stock for the entire holiday season.  At the end of Monday, Barnes and Noble's warehouses were empty and Amazon was oversold by nearly 20,000 orders.  Another sizable shipment was en route from the printer, but that was immediately evaporated by the backlog.  (If you ordered through Monday, you should be fine).

I wish I could say that the book will be available online shortly.  But it's not looking good.  We have another shipment of 25k books due around the 10th-- but online sales have remained strong despite the ""Out of Stock"" message, and a large chunk of those have already been claimed.  That means there are only a few thousand more unclaimed books in the pipeline.  

Printers are overloaded during the holiday season, and for awhile it was looking like me might have no new books before Christmas.  But the CEO of Macmillan (bless his soul) made a high level call, and it's looking (fingers crossed) like we might have managed to get another 50 to 75k coming off the press on Dec. 16th, arriving in warehouses on the 17th and 18th.  Obviously, with shipping times, this will be cutting it close.  So I'll keep everyone in the loop.  

But I just wanted to let everyone know that if you are waiting for Amazon to say ""In Stock,"" you may be waiting awhile.   And I'd hate for the book to become unavailable elsewhere in the meantime.  You'd be better off going to your local bookseller.  Barnes and Noble still have a decent amount of stock in-store, especially in the New York area. The indies have decent stocks.  (Again, especially in New York-- Posman, Word, Strand, etc).  But when those stocks go, there will be almost nothing in the pipeline to resupply-- until the 17th or 18th, at the earliest, hopefully.

On one hand, this is all obviously very exciting to me because we sold so many books.  But there already is, and will continue to be, a major supply issue this holiday season-- especially online.  And I wanted the people who follow the blog to be the first to know about it, in case you had your heart set on a HONY book.

Anyway, um, happy holidays!

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","HONY For The Holidays was an experiment we tried for the first time last year, where we found holiday dinners for people who happened to be stuck in New York with no place to go for Christmas.  (The idea emerged from my experience during the early days of HONY, when I was too broke to go home, and spent Christmas Eve at a 24 hour diner.  So I know how much it sucks.)  My girlfriend organized the whole thing, and we ended up matching about 15 or 20 people with families who had an extra place at the table.  It was really cool.

Anyway, my girlfriend is ready to do it again this year.  She's pretty fired up about it, actually.  I gently reminded her that the audience is 20x larger this time around, but she was undeterred.  She's had her Excel spreadsheet ready for days, and I even got yelled at last night for not posting anything yet.
""I'll do it tomorrow,"" I told her.
""You said that yesterday,"" she said.

So please, if you can spare an extra spot at the table this Christmas, please be in touch.  And if you have no place to go this Christmas, please be in touch.  We'll match you up with somebody, and much cheer will be had.  We'll also make sure everyone is well acquainted before they meet, so there will be no surprises: honyfortheholidays@gmail.com

The attached picture is from one of the dinners last year.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Dear Brandon,

My boyfriend had given me a copy of your book as a gift for our sixth anniversary today. Curiously perplexed by his uncharacteristic gesture, I observed the pages to come across a photo of us, standing on 42nd street, exactly one year earlier. Shock sprawled across my face and emotion flooded my heart. My mind wandered back to the six months that had preceded this night, which had relentlessly challenged our hearts and nearly broken our bond. It was this night, on our fifth anniversary, that we vowed not to give up; and it was this night that began the start of our greatest year together. I never imagined that I would be staring into this moment again. A moment so fleeting that it had escaped us, lost to the chaos of our times; yet here it is, so beautifully captured and for all the world to see. Though we may be strangers, you have given us the greatest gift of all. Thank you so very much.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","So two years ago I adopted this crazy looking 11 year old dog named Susie.  She sort of fell into my path in a way that seemed predetermined, but I'd never had a dog before and was really unsure about the responsibilities involved.  But I went ahead and got her, and it turned out to be the best decision of my life. 

Susie is sitting next to me right now, as always, because Susie's main concern in life seems to be remaining as close to me as possible.  Like I said, I'd never had a dog before, so I'm constantly amazed at how much this little creature loves me.  I feel like other dog owners know the feeling. 

I've only had Susie for two years now, but she's been to seven states, dipped her paws in both oceans, and eaten tons of chicken.  It's been a very full two years and I really can't imagine life without her.  So, anyway, the point of all this:

My girlfriend and Susie have teamed up to start a page that features senior dogs looking for an owner.  I think it's a great idea, because senior dogs have a tough time getting adopted even though they are extremely laid back roommates.  They enjoy a good walk as much as the next dog, but they are also down with chillaxing all day and watching Breaking Bad.

I get nervous as the blog grows that the culture will fall apart, but with 2.7 million and counting-- the HONY comment section remains a sort of rare internet jewel where everyone, for the most part, is really nice.  And when there is a mean comment, it sticks out as an anomaly, instead of the other way around.  So thanks for that.

Hi Brandon,  

I'm Ted, we met getting off the Six at Grand Central.  When I got home Sunday evening, I had an e-mail from friends in Chicago.  One of their daughters reads your blog (is that what it is called?), and recognized me even though she has never seen me with a beard.  I am astounded!  I've read about 1000 of the comments, words cannot express how touched I am by what I have read.  Its actually more than touched, it has been very emotional to read the wonderful things people have said.  A couple people appear confused about what happened, for the record she had acute myelogenous leukemia, we were diagnosed July 2008, we lost our battle February 20 2013, not quite a year ago.  Thanks for doing this, it has really touched my life.  The most wonderful people in the world read your material and comment on it.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Because of all the attention of this morning's library post, I thought it'd only be fair to post the NYPL's response. I'm quoting four points that they've asked me to clarify:

*The man says ""I work at this Library."" Ends up, he doesn't ""work"" for the library in the sense of being an employee. He is probably doing his work at the library (millions do each year!). We fear the confusion might make people think he is offering his opinion as an employee.

*The vast majority of research books will remain on the site (in far superior storage conditions)

*None of the public spaces he and others enjoy will change, and we'll be returning a circulating collection to this main library (it had one for its first 70 years).

*This plan will be greatly expanding access to the library. The renovation will allow all New Yorkers–scholars, students, educators, immigrants, job-seekers– to take advantage of this beautiful building and its world-class collections.

Obviously the issue is more complex than soundbites from either side, so feel free to educate yourself further and form your own opinion:

I'm currently advocating on behalf of my child, and seventeen other children whose parents don't speak English.  These kids are from Ecuador, Peru, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, everywhere.  These kids have all done very well on their Regent's exams-- I'm talking 90/95th percentile.  Very smart kids.  They were on their way toward qualifying for an Advanced Regents government scholarship,that would give their parents badly needed money to help in their education.  But the fine print of that scholarship says the children need three full years of a foreign language. 

And the principal at the school FIRED the Spanish teacher.  She is not hiring another foreign language teacher for an entire year, effectively disqualifying all these kids from that scholarship they need.  When we try to talk with her about it, she acts like she doesn't owe us an explanation.  When we try to call the Board of Education, they tell us to put it in writing.  They get us all excited.  They have us think if we write a nice letter, and use good grammar, and use all the correct punctuation, something will happen.  Meanwhile another year passes, and nothing.  And the kids don't get their scholarship.  You know something like this would never happen at a nice Manhattan school like Stuyvesant.

We've got a new mayor and a new chancellor.  So we aren't blaming them.  But they need to know how impossible they've made it to help our kids.  Trying to get something fixed in these schools is like praying to some false God.  You call and email hoping that God is listening, and nothing happens.  Meanwhile the kids suffer.  All these parents that I'm representing are good, simple people.  They say: 'Don't worry Annette, God is going to fix it.  God will make it right.'  I love them.  And I love God.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Pretty much the exact same time we signed a deal for the HONY book, we began working on a HONY kids' book too.  Over the last couple years, it went through a few different concepts and rewrites, until we ended up with the treasure that is LITTLE HUMANS.  The final product ended up being a  short narrative about what it means to be a little human.  On each page there is a kid portrait which illustrates each aspect of little humanity.  (Several of the photos have not been posted to the blog, which required a lot of self-restraint, because I especially love the kid posts.)  

Little Humans was so fun to write, I'm really proud of it, and am really excited for everyone to see it.  I must also disclose that my girlfriend brought instrumental kid-knowledge to the table, gathered from years of intensive babysitting. 

The book is for ages 2 to 7, and will be released on October 7th.  You can preorder it here:

Impervious to popular clamor, winners of the 2014 HuMPAs were chosen based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: artistry, relevance to modern social movements, the fact that I have to meet my girlfriend for dinner in 30 minutes, pathos, irony, use of kittens as humor, use of kittens as metaphor, historical context, and narrative arc.  

The HuMPAs Academy has selected 7 winners.  
They are, in no particular order:

Hustle Man Visits Pediatric Cancer Ward (Sierra Bonn)
Hustle Man Vs Babe Ruth (Erika Dame Smith)
Hustle Man Unites Berlin (Kasey Colluci)
Hustle Man Saves Kittens and Snakes (Kirstyn Soles)

So I'm trying to develop a system to help blind children develop literacy as soon as possible.  If you think about it, books for young children are picture-driven, with very few words per page.  So it's tough for blind kids to really participate.  So we recommend pre-reading activities to build the scene before the story begins.  If you're reading Goldilocks for example, take the child to the kitchen first, allow them to feel where the scene is going to be set.  If the story is about a lamb, get a fluffy towel, so they can feel what a lamb looks like.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Hey Everyone,

Wanted to say a quick word about the comment section.  Been getting some emails from people who have been banned.  So I wanted to clear a few things up.  First of all, nobody has actually been banned.  Anyone can see the material.  You MAY no longer be able to comment.  But rest assured, this was not my decision.  I have assistants who moderate the comment section.  So, I assure you, I did not make a personal decision to hate/persecute/silence/oppress you.  I'm sure we actually have the same worldview.  No doubt we are walking arm-in-arm toward the bright dawn of a new day.

But the moderators have very clear instructions: ban anyone who is attacking the subject.  If you're attacking the subject with an erudite, graduate level vocabulary, you're still attacking the subject.  Again, you're not being oppressed, silenced, persecuted, or targeted for your beliefs.  I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I'm absolutely sure of it.  But please, write about it on your own blog.  Humans of New York can continue to exist without your enlightenment.  But it can't exist without subjects.  Some of you may have noticed recently that some portraits have disappeared shortly after being posted.  You can now probably guess why this happened. So if you're making HONY an uncomfortable place to be, by using the comment section to cast extreme judgment on someone you know only through a single quote, you are probably going to be banned from commenting.  We don't hate you.  Not a bit.  Feel free to continue enjoying HONY.  Just no more comments.

For the most part, I love the comment section.  There are plenty of awesome ways to contribute to the discussion without being judgmental.  My favorites are personal anecdotes.  If you can add to the subject's experience by sharing a similar or contrasting experience, that is awesome.  I really think it expands the work.  Just please, keep it about you.  Also feel free to joke.  We aren't stiff or prudish.  But we do know the difference between being funny and being a dick.  And you should too.  As always, feel free to comfort or encourage.  I still firmly believe this place has the nicest five million people on the internet.  

Thanks everybody.  
Hoping to keep this a good place as we grow.

But right away I got a job at a sporting goods store.  Soon I was able to get a job as a receptionist at a tax company, and they gave me enough responsibilities that I learned how to do taxes.  Eventually I learned enough to become an associate.  Then I got offered a job at a smaller company, and even though it was a pay cut, they offered me responsibility over all the books-- accounts payable, accounts receivable, everything.  It was less money but I wanted that experience so I took the risk.  And I'm so glad I did, because six months later, the controller of that company left and I was given that position.  They told me they couldn't officially call me the controller because I didn't have a college degree.  So I finished my degree 5 months ago-- just to make it official!

So if you think you may ever want a dog, know somebody who may want a dog, or just want to be encouraged by some of the wonderful adoption stories-- please consider following the page.

The police commissioner had figured out that all the people committing small crimes were the same people committing big crimes, so the cops started cracking down on all the little stuff-- and crime kept going down, down, down. Everything except bank robberies. Because all the big national banks were moving into the city, and buying out all the local banks. And these new corporate banks were all about 'customer service.' So they replaced the retired cops at the doors with 'greeters' who would give you coffee and donuts. So word got around fast that robbing banks was fucking easy now. All you had to do was walk in, hand them a note, and they'd hand over the cash. I never even carried a gun. The security footage was so grainy back then, you could barely see anything. It was easy. It's much tougher these days. I've had dye packs explode on me three times. The worst was about a block from here. I had just left a bank, and was walking by the entrance to Penn Station during morning rush hour. Suddenly a noise starts coming from my pants, and a bright neon cloud starts shooting out.

One morning, we decided to make a run for the hospital, so that we could put ourselves under the protection of the Red Cross.  Our neighbors were running in front of us, pushing their belongings on a pushcart, when they stepped on a land mine and the whole family was killed.  We kept running, but when we got to the main street, there was a checkpoint and we weren’t allowed to cross.  So we hid beneath a house, and soon we were discovered by Japanese soldiers.  They lined us all up against the wall to be executed.  We begged and begged and begged for our lives.  They finally allowed my mother and the children to step aside, but they told my father to stay.

I'll be posting portraits and stories from the trip on the blog.  We're calling it a 'World Tour,' because the trip will span over 25,000 miles and circumnavigate the globe.  But since there are only ten countries on the itinerary, it would be rather foolish to claim that these portraits and stories somehow represent 'the world,' or humanity as a whole.  The point of the trip is not to ""say"" anything about the world.  But rather to visit some faraway places, and listen to as many people as possible.   

In addition to gathering portraits and stories, the purpose of the tour is to raise awareness for the Millennium Development Goals, which are pictured.  The MDG's are eight international development goals that every member state of the UN agreed we should accomplish by the year 2015.  Basically: they're stuff that everyone can agree the world needs. (More info can be found here: http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/).  So in addition to telling stories of individuals, we hope this trip may in some way help to inspire a global perspective, while bringing awareness to the challenges that we all need to tackle together.

But with  people fleeing war, it is absolutely impossible to discuss anything beyond the present moment.  Their circumstances are so overpowering, there is absolutely zero room in their minds for any other thoughts.  The conversation immediately stalls, because any topic of conversation beyond their present despair seems grossly inappropriate.

At its peak last year, over 3,000 Syrians refugees were entering the camp every day. This was a biblical level of population movement. Over 400,000 people have lived in the camp at some point in the last two years. UNHCR has responded to their basic needs: sanitation, food, healthcare. But there's a large gap between survival and livelihood. For lack of a better word, boredom has become a big problem. It's too dangerous to return to Syria, and there are very limited ways to be productive inside the camp. But the adaptations have been amazing. This is unlike any other refugee camp in the world. The Syrians are coming from a middle class economy, so they are a very skilled population-- they aren't subsistence farmers. They've managed to build an economy inside the camp. Most of the tents have been upgraded to houses. The refugees trade with the Jordanians, and bring in supplies from the outside to start their own shops. One man even started a supermarket. It's still a tough situation. But arriving with nothing, the Syrian refugees have managed to carve out their own dignity inside the camp. They aren't just taking what is given to them. They've created choices for themselves.""

He'd taken a bus into the city alone, and he was calling me to ask if I could help him find a way to go to school.  Both of his parents had died of AIDS, and he had no money for tuition.  I told him to stay where he was, and left work immediately to pick him up.  At first I was very mad at him.  He should not have travelled alone.  But then I looked at him and I saw myself.  I'd also been desperate to go to school after my father was killed, but we had no money.  So even though I was suffering myself, I told him I would try to help him.  My salary was not enough, so I tried many things to get the money.  After work, I went to the landfill to hunt for recyclables.  But after I paid to have them cleaned, there was no money left.  Now I'm trying to make bricks.  I have a small operation in the village to make bricks, and I sell them in the city.  It doesn't make much money, but it's enough to pay tuition for the boy and three of his siblings.""

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","South Sudan is a difficult place to explain.  It's one of those places where it is impossible to separate the political and the personal, because the dominant themes of every personal life have been shaped by political circumstances.  Very few people in South Sudan have hopes, fears, happiest moments, and saddest moments, that are entirely divorced from the conflict that has enveloped the country.  The fighting here has been going on for so long, that the root causes of the violence are complex, interwoven, and difficult to ascertain.  South Sudan was established as a country in 2011, following a 20 year civil war with northern Sudan.  This war was largely a religious and ethnic conflict, which often descended into genocide-- most famously in the Darfur region.  Millions of civilians were killed. 

Three years ago, when South Sudan finally achieved it's independence from the north, there was a great deal of optimism.  But late last year, a political battle between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar ignited a new civil war.  Because the two men were from different tribes, the fighting has once again broken out along ethnic lines.  Ethnic war is an an especially deadly sort of conflict because it can easily spill over into civilian populations.

Fighting in the new civil war is largely between the Dinka and the Nuer, South Sudan's two dominant tribes.  Many of the posts from the next few days were collected at an Internally Displaced Persons Site within the UN compound in Juba.  The people in these posts are members of the Nuer tribe.  When fighting broke out, they stormed the gates of the UN to escape an unfolding massacre at the hands of Dinka fighters.  Over the course of a few days, thousands of Nuer were gunned down in the capital city, where they represented a significant minority.  

In other parts of the country, Dinka were killed with equal indiscrimination in heavily Nuer regions.  I provide this context only to make clear that this is not a story of victim vs. aggressor.  But rather the latest outbreak of violence in a new country with a troubled history that is filled with violence, distrust, and racial animosities.  But South Sudan is also a country filled with millions of civilians who are desperately, and with the greatest difficulty, trying to transcend this history and establish a society based on democratic and equalitarian ideals.

To make matters worse, she had left her older children behind in her village, because she thought it would just be a short trip. She had not seen them in nearly a year. As I was interviewing her, she kept a very resigned, unsmiling, faraway look on her face, which can be seen in the previous post. But when we finished, my translator asked her what village she was from. When she told him, he pulled out his phone. ""I've just been to your hometown on an aid mission,"" he said, ""I can show you photos."" As he scrolled through photos of her village, her expression suddenly changed.

I was greeted by Cathy, the center's director.  She was very kind, but also a bit nervous about my presence.  She'd been briefed about my interview process.  ""We can talk about happy moments,"" she said.  ""But let's not ask these children about their saddest moments, or times they felt afraid.  Many of them were malnourished, abandoned, or regularly sexually abused.  Some of them have witnessed extreme violence.  When journalists ask them to relive these memories, it can set them back for an entire month.  They begin to act out.  Often their trauma is so bad, that when the children first arrive, they can be very hateful toward me.  But I feel blessed by the hate.  Because I know it's part of the healing process.  And if they need someone to hate so that they can heal, I'm glad it can be me.""

A few minutes after this conversation, a young girl walked up to Cathy, gave her a hug, and ran away.  Cathy seemed quite moved.  ""That girl was very badly abused,"" she said.  ""She's been here for months.  And that's the first time she's ever hugged me.""

Lord Rama was known as a revealer of truth.  So I joked with my best friend that my son was going to be just like Lord Rama, and he was going to bring a great truth into the world.  Sixteen years later, that very same friend called me while I was out of town on vacation.  
'Uptal!' he screamed. 'Uptal! Turn on the TV!  Your son is on the TV!  He's just like Lord Rama!'
'What channel?' I asked.
'Any channel!' he screamed.  So I turned on the television.  And there he was.  I hadn't known it, but while I was gone, he had started a petition on the internet.  He was only sixteen years old at the time, and he had started an online petition calling for the government to reopen an old rape case.  The case was nearly ten years old, and it involved the son of a very powerful government official.  The son had raped and murdered a girl, and even though the evidence was overwhelming, he was only given three years in prison because of his family's connections.  So Aditya started this petition to reopen the case.  And soon it had millions of signatures!    A sixteen year old boy!  I couldn't believe it!  I called his mother, and she was very scared.  The men he was challenging were very powerful, and had many powerful friends.  
Soon Aditya was on the cover of every newspaper: 'Young Boy Challenges Mafia,"" the newspapers said.  TV cameras were lining up in front of our house.  His mother and I were very scared for him, and wanted him to lay low, but he insisted on doing every interview.  He went on all the TV shows.  Soon he started a protest right here at India Gate.  He announced: 'I am going to sit here until the case is reopened.'  Thousands of people joined him.  All the famous musicians and Bollywood stars came to join him.  The largest magazine in India called him 'the country's youngest icon.'  Soon after the protest began, the chief judge of the Supreme Court announced he was reopening the case.  When the new trial was finished, the man had been given a life sentence!""

Led by the Dalai Lama, nearly 100,000 Tibetan refugees live in this northern Indian city, where they seek to maintain their traditions and culture in exile.  The long journey from Tibet to India includes a grueling 28 day walk through the Himalayan mountains.  Many of the refugees make this trek as children, sent by their parents in hopes of studying their language and religion in freedom.  In conclusion, here's a young Tibetan monk playing with a kitten.

I think now we are all starting to think that the Chinese are too powerful and that the dream of returning home is fading away.  I think our mistake was that we didn't keep up with the world.  We held on to the monastic tradition too tightly.  We didn't embrace modern education, and so we weren't connected with the outside world.  Because of that, we lost our freedom silently.

I was going to wait until I got home to start banging that drum, but my agent emailed me that my publisher is ""freaking out a bit"" that I haven't mentioned it in so long.  So allow me to announce that LITTLE HUMANS IS GOING TO BE THE GREATEST KIDS BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE.  :) 

According to Publisher's Weekly, ""the vivid collection underscores both the diversity and commonality among children, and may well inspire readers to imagine the lives and stories behind each child.""  Kirkus Reviews says the photographs are ""so striking"" and bring such ""large delight,"" that you won't notice the text is a ""little platitudinous."" (Let's be honest-- we don't know what 'platitudinous' means, and neither do your kids.  And anyone who uses that word is not getting invited to our birthday parties.)

But in 100% seriousness, I'm really looking forward to the next few weeks because me, my girlfriend, my dog, my mom, my friends, my editor, and everyone involved in Little Humans thinks that this book came out perfect.  It was really a labor of love.  So I'm looking forward to seeing if you, your girlfriend, your dog, your mom, your friends, your editor, and your kids love Little Humans as much as we do. 

If you're planning on getting the book anyway, you can help my publisher get some sleep by preordering now.  The book will ship on October 7th:

For everyone who lives around NYC, or plans to be in New York during October, a few public events which have been scheduled locally around the book launch:

I'm going to be giving a speech on October 7th at the 92nd St. Y, which is officially billed as a ""Launch Event for Little Humans,"" but seeing that I have an hour to talk, will most likely take the form of a general discussion about the history and process behind HONY.  I enjoy telling HONY's history and demonstrating the work, so we'll have fun.  This event is ticketed-- it's $40 I think, which is a bit rich, but 100% of the money goes to support the Y's community programs.  (And some of the ticket price can be put toward a purchase of Little Humans.)  Unfortunately I just learned that most of the tickets were sold before I could make the announcement, and there are only about 300 left.  Those tickets are available here: http://bit.ly/1xB60S5

A free, more 'easily attendable' event will be the book signing at Union Square Barnes and Noble on October 11th, which begins at 2 PM.  This event was a lot of fun last year with the launch of the adult book.  Since this is a children's book, we'll keep it fun and playful.  We scheduled it on the weekend so you can bring the kids and dogs, though I'm not sure dogs are allowed in the bookstore, so you may want to disguise them as kids.  For those of you with tickets to Comic Con, I will also be speaking there at on October 12th at 3:15 PM.  Then October 18th, at 4:00 PM, I'll be doing a talk/signing at Powerhouse Arena in Brooklyn. Last year, the final Powerhouse signing was the most unhurried and intimate event, though this year it might not be because I just said it would be.  We also scheduled that signing during the weekend, because it would be awesome to have little humans at the Little Humans book signing.

He couldn’t even say his name, but he always passed by the store and gave off the warmest feelings.  My father began to invite him in, and soon he was coming by the store every day to play.  When he started spending time with us, he began to improve very quickly.  We told him we needed his help with the shop.  We think that all he needed was something to hope for.  He began to tell us all about his feelings.  He visited with everyone who came into the shop.  He learned bits of English and Japanese.   He changed our lives so much.  My father loved him like a son, and he loved my father.  They would always laugh together and dance together.  When my Father died, he was very sad for five months.  He still prays for my father every time he eats a meal.   Lately, all he can talk about is a girl in his class that he wants to marry.  She also has Down Syndrome.  Every day he talks about the wedding he will have, and he invites everyone he sees.  He has invited over 5,000 people so far.  He tells each person what they are supposed to bring to the wedding. His father will not allow him to get married.  But we are thinking about having a ‘wedding party,’ and inviting everyone in the town.”

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","“Your brain is growing at a rapid rate during adolescence.  There’s a lot of emotion, confusion, thrill seeking.  It’s a time when you try a lot of things and make a lot of mistakes.  We all went through it.  But in this neighborhood, there’s not a lot of maneuverability.  There’s not a lot of room for teens to make mistakes, and the mistakes have higher consequences.  To make things worse, adolescence seems to be prolonged here.  Many young people in the community view adolescence as a pinnacle, and not a stage.  Girls become mothers at a young age.  Fathers are absent, so young boys are forced to act like men.  So what you have are adolescents who become authority figures, and spread the adolescent mindset through the community.  Instead of thinking through a conflict, young men feel a social pressure to immediately react, so they don’t appear ‘soft’ or ‘weak.’  That’s one of the reasons I feel that mentorship programs are so important.  They give adolescents a space to remain adolescents.”","2014-10-26T16:55:01+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/795501310523971/?type=3","102099916530784_795573543850081",240962,4568,22846

Before the divorce, I was a working father.  Work always took priority.  I knew that if I had to skip a soccer game for a work meeting, my wife would be able to take the kids to the game.  After the divorce, I only got to see my kids every Tuesday night, every other Monday, and every other weekend.  It completely changed my mindset-- I went from being a working father to being a parent.  If there was a work obligation during my time with the kids, I had to change it.  I couldn’t spend weekend mornings at the gym anymore, because that would cut into my time.  I began cooking dinner on my nights so we could all eat together.

I'm the teenage girl you met earlier today when I was walking with my dad and we talked for a little while about about my eating disorder, but I realized that I didn’t quite give the answers I felt were completely honest or were what I wanted to say. Thinking about it, what I really should have and wanted to say was that this whole experience of having an eating disorder has been complete shit, and it’s the hardest thing I have ever and probably will ever do. There’s no specific moment that has been particularly hard that my dad has helped me through, because the entire time it has just been an ongoing nightmare. 
 If this is what you want for the caption, I could keep going into great depth about what it’s like having an eating disorder, portraying it in a multitude of metaphors and descriptions that would give people something meaningful to respond or react to. But even still, this probably wouldn’t come close to giving people an idea of how difficult, confusing, draining and indescribable this disease is. 
 However, since this was originally about my dad and I, I wanted to say that another reason I can’t think of a specific time he’s helped, is because he has been here for me through all of it. The entire time, he has been trying his hardest to help me beat this, which I realize has been incredibly hard on him too, and I’m very appreciative and grateful for that.  Whether you decide to use this (or part of) as the caption or not, thanks for reading it and allowing me to explain myself. By the way, would it be okay if you used the picture of our hands and left out my name?

There was a pharmaceutical company coming out with a new drug, and I got a tip that it was going to be approved by the FDA.  And the sources who were telling me this had always been right before.  So I bet everything.  I thought: ‘I’m going to double my money really quick, and then I’m getting out.  I’m going to use the money to start my own business.’  I even borrowed money to put into this stock.  I was that sure.  99%.

Suddenly I’d lost everything, and I didn’t even own my apartment anymore.  I couldn’t get out of bed for months.  I stopped eating and dropped to 125 lbs.

For those of you who missed out on the raiding party, HONY BOOKS ARE $10.50 for the next 48 hours.  (These books retail for $29.99 and wholesale for $15, so these books are actually being sold below cost.)  If you are buying HONY or Little Humans as Christmas gifts, they will never be cheaper.

ALSO, through the weekend, SIGNED DINO EDITIONS are being sold for $15 in every Barnes and Noble store in the country.  They are called Dino Editions because I drew extremely obscure dinosaurs on the title pages.   I can’t remember exactly why I had that idea, but I did.  (Picture in Comments)

------------------------------------

Again, please forgive the book advertisements.  I bend over backwards to keep HONY as non-commercial as possible, but these books are my only source of income from the page, so on four or five days every year I attempt to playfully remind everyone of their existence.

There was one bear named Moscow who had a broken eye and ripped ear, and I’d always make sure that the other animals were especially nice to him.  So I knew early on that I wanted to be a special education teacher.  This is a photo of the first play group that I organized outside of class.  I was teaching at the time, and a lot of my parents were telling me that their children weren’t socializing with other members of the family, and it was very painful for them.  So I organized an after-school playgroup in my basement.  I’d work with the children on their interaction skills, while the mothers had a support group upstairs.  The support group was very important for them.  It’s very hard to be the parent of a special needs child.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","ATTENTION:  HONY For The Holidays is an annual tradition where we match up people who have nowhere to go for Christmas with people who have an extra place, or five extra places, at their table.  As someone who moved to this city without knowing anybody--- I know that holidays are the ABSOLUTE WORST.  I think I spent my first Christmas Eve in New York at a 24 hour diner, because I didn't have the money to go home.  If you think you're heading for a similar situation this Christmas, get in touch, and we'll set you up with some great food and good company.  (Don't be shy-- this doesn't mean you don't have any friends.  It just means that circumstances have conspired against you for the holidays.)

And if you already have a happy holiday planned, please consider making room for one extra person.

HONY For The Holidays is very carefully screened and organized by my girlfriend Erin.  (God bless her angelic, senior-dog-rescuing soul.)  She works very hard to match people up, and makes sure that everyone is acquainted beforehand so there are no surprises.  It's a lot of work every year, so to make it easier on her, please only reply if you've given it some thought and are serious about participating.

Please email: honyfortheholidays@gmail.com
If you'd like a place at a table, write GUEST in the subject line
If you have a place at the table, write HOST in the subject line
Include your approximate location and a little bit about yourself!
If you can host, let us know how many people you can accommodate.
Unfortunately, we are only able to match people in NYC.  (Or close by.)

Thanks everyone!  Last year we had almost 100 matches and nobody had a bad experience.  So take a chance and let's make it even more awesome this year.","2014-12-15T21:04:43+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/836079719799463/?type=3","102099916530784_836080543132714",171490,7365,16603

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I posted a portrait of Ramon on Christmas Day.  In the caption, Ramon explained the difficulties of being homeless and disabled.  He had been living at a shelter for several months-- a tough situation made even tougher by his lack of mobility.  Everyone was quite moved by his story, and seeing that it was Christmas and all, we launched a holiday fundraiser to get Ramon out of the shelter and into an apartment.  But after three minutes, Ramon texted me, and said: ""Thank you so much, really, but I feel that there are other people who need the money more, so I'd like to figure things out on my own.""  Given Ramon's situation, it was a pretty heroic display of self-reliance. 

Yesterday I brought Ramon the $800 that had been raised in the first few minutes of the fundraiser, which he graciously agreed to accept so that he could buy a bed.  And he very happily reported that he was now out of the shelter, and had found an affordable place in Brooklyn to share with his three brothers, one of whom is pictured here.","2015-01-17T15:46:01+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/864243823649719/?type=3","102099916530784_864244003649701",354123,5032,7442

“This is a neighborhood that doesn’t necessarily expect much from our children, so at Mott Hall Bridges Academy we set our expectations very high.  We don’t call the children ‘students,’ we call them ‘scholars.’   Our color is purple.  Our scholars wear purple and so do our staff.  Because purple is the color of royalty.  I want my scholars to know that even if they live in a housing project, they are part of a royal lineage going back to great African kings and queens.  They belong to a group of individuals who invented astronomy and math.   And they belong to a group of individuals who have endured so much history and still overcome.  When you tell people you’re from Brownsville, their face cringes up.  But there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed.”","2015-01-22T15:45:03+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/868248166582618/?type=3","102099916530784_868248219915946",586519,16390,48627
"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I spent yesterday afternoon in a brainstorming session with Ms. Lopez and her Director of Programs Ms. Achu, trying to think of creative ways that the HONY community could help further the vision of Mott Hall Bridges Academy.  Our discussion covered many needs, but we kept returning to one in particular-- the limited horizons of disadvantaged youth.   Ms. Lopez’s school is situated in a neighborhood with the highest crime rate in New York, and many of her scholars have very limited mobility.  Some of them are very much ‘stuck’ in their neighborhood.  And many have never left the city.  “It can be very difficult for them to dream beyond what they know,” Ms. Lopez explained. 

So the three of us struck on an idea.  (OK, it was Ms. Achu’s idea, but we all agreed.)  We want to create a fund that will provide each incoming 6th grade class at Mott Hall Bridges Academy a chance to get out of their neighborhood and visit a new place.  And that place is Harvard University.  “I want every child who enters my school to know that they can go anywhere, and that they will belong,” said Ms. Lopez.

So we’re going to try to make it happen!  Let’s help this visionary educator enrich the lives of her students.

It had been a tough week for many of the teachers, and from the heavy energy in the room, I could feel the immense difficulty of their jobs.  ""It can be especially hard when you come back from holiday break,"" Ms. Lopez explained.  ""Because it can feel like so much of the progress you made last semester was undone during the break.  It's hard, it's hard, it's hard.  And it's OK for you to feel like you want to give up.  You can quit anytime you want, and I will pick up the phone and recommend you for a new job, because every one of you could succeed anywhere.  But these kids need you.  Our girls don't feel honored and respected.  Our boys are being recruited into gangs.  Your classrooms may be the one place they feel safe and respected.  If we give up, there is nobody else.  There is a system out there that is waiting for our scholars to show up in shackles and jumpsuits if we choose to give up on them.""

We are currently holding a campaign to institute an annual class trip to Harvard for students at Ms. Lopez's school, Mott Hall Bridges Academy.  Thanks to everyone who's donated, we have raised $185,000 in just a few hours.  That is a transformative amount of money, and will fund this initiative for over six years.  I would love to continue adding to the fund, so that this trip will become a permanent part of the school's backbone.  In turn, it will hopefully help MHBA become a permanent part of the community's backbone.  If you haven't already donated, please take a look: http://bit.ly/1JmIB8u

With two weeks left in the fundraiser, I sat down with Ms. Lopez today to learn the best way that we could continue to help her secure a bright future for her students.

“We have a major need for a summer program,” she explained.  “Learning stops during the summer for my scholars.  We have what is called a ‘summer slide.’  My scholars can’t even go outside.  It’s too dangerous.  As an exercise, my teachers broke into small groups and took a walk through the community.  We wanted to understand how our students live.  We went inside the housing projects.  The parks and playgrounds were empty because it’s too dangerous.  Even the library isn’t a safe zone.  Just last Saturday, one of my scholars had two guns pulled on him while he was walking to the community center.  In broad daylight.  It’s just too dangerous to be outside, so my scholars stay inside all summer.  They aren’t learning to ride horses or drive boats, and they certainly aren’t traveling.  They miss out on the enrichment available to children from more affluent neighborhoods.  They need a safe place where they can do activities and continue to grow their minds.  I tried to put together a program last summer, but I couldn’t afford it.  I couldn’t really put together any activities, and I could only use teachers-in-training.  I need the funds to put together a program with my own teachers so my students have a safe place where they can continue to grow outside of school.”

Ms. Lopez estimates that an effective summer program will cost about $40,000 a year.  So every $40,000 beyond the $350,000 we’ve already raised will provide another “safe and productive summer “ for the students at Mott Hall Bridges Academy.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I only had a few minutes to speak with Ms. Lopez yesterday because she was hosting a conference for the district’s principals.  (Because that’s the kind of thing Ms. Lopez does.)  Attending the conference was Ms. Mauriciere de Govia, the superintendent of Brownsville’s school district, who was kind enough to speak with me for a few minutes in a quiet stairwell.  I asked for her opinion on Ms. Lopez:

“Nadia is fearless.  When she says that every kid can learn, she means it.  And not only does she mean it, she puts systems in place to make it happen.  It all begins with high expectations.  When students arrive at this school, many of them are very behind.  But Nadia sets high expectations on every one.  She never says: ‘This student lives in the shelter so he deserves a break.” Or ‘Because of his parents, this student can’t be expected to keep up.’  She says: ‘This is how we do things here, and there is no sidestepping.’”

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","One of the coolest things about this fundraiser is that it originated with a young man on the street, who chose to tell a stranger about the love and appreciation he had for his school principal.  His name is Vidal, and I had a chance to reconnect with him during my visit to Mott Hall Bridges Academy.  He could not possibly be a more polite or charismatic young man.

“I want to own my own restaurant,” he told me.   “When I was little, I used to watch my mom cook.  Then I started cooking for myself when I was nine.  I’d get the ingredients myself at the corner store and make something for my brothers.  I just thought it was a good thing for an older brother to do.  I can make curry chicken, jerk chicken, curry goat, fried rice, macaroni and cheese, and all kinds of stuff.”
“What would you say has been your biggest accomplishment?”
“Getting publicity for my school.”

There were always a lot of people in that neighborhood who would make us feel like we didn’t belong.  They would try to send a message that blacks aren’t allowed.

He would shake each one of our hands as we stepped off the bus, and he made us feel like we belonged.

There were fewer students, and more resources, but there was not the same desire to learn.  I’ve had to learn to teach motivation.

There is little opportunity available to you, and many people are competing with you.  But as you educate yourself, the room grows.  You have more opportunities, and less people competing with you.’  I always remembered that.  My mother died when I was twelve.  I started working as a maid when I turned thirteen.  I made 5 cents a day, which I saved for school.  There was no free education in Nigeria.   When I ran out of money, I’d stop going to school and go back to work.  Stop, work, go back to school.

Taken together, these donations have provided funding for ten years worth of Harvard trips, and ten years worth of summer programs.  Your donations have given a heavy boost to a group of scholars and educators in their battle to establish a culture of success in a disadvantaged neighborhood.   There was an assembly today where the full impact of the fundraiser was explained to all of the students, and it was quite emotional.  (But more on that later.)

I wanted to announce that all funds raised over $700,000 will be reserved for a final purpose.  We are starting a scholarship fund available to the graduates of Mott Hall Bridges Academy.  A committee of MHBA educators and administrators will choose the recipients each year.  We’re going to use the money from our campaign to get the fund started, but we’re also going to lay tracks so that it can continue to assist scholars for years to come.  It will be called The Vidal Scholarship Fund.  And the first recipient will be Vidal himself.

“The scholars of MHBA are inspiring the entire world,” Ms. Lopez said.  “People have written me letters from New Zealand, England, and South Africa, telling me that they care about you.”  An especially great part of the assembly was when Ms. Lopez scrolled through the posts featuring teachers, and the students let out a giant cheer when each teacher’s name was announced: 

""Even Ms. Powell told her story!""  (Cheers)  
""And Ms. Stangl!""   (Cheers) 
""And Mr. Turner!"" (Cheers)

I’m afraid they don’t think they’re good enough.’ And she told me to pray on it. But I told her, ‘I might be too angry to pray.’ And I know this is hard to believe, because you guys have never seen me break. But I was broken. It’s just like when you see your mom break down. You only see your mom cry when she’s been fighting so hard for you and she doesn’t think you care. That’s how I felt. But then a couple nights later I was with my daughter at a Broadway show, and we were waiting for the show to start, and I started to get all these text messages from my teachers and former students. And then I saw Vidal’s face pop up on my screen. And my first thought was that something bad had happened. Because that’s normally the case around here when someone’s photo shows up unexpectedly. And the moment I realized that Vidal had said something nice about me, the usher came over and made me turn off my phone. When intermission came, my daughter said: ‘Mom, we’ve got to find out what’s happening.’ So we went and sat in the car. And I read what Vidal said, and I began to read the comments. And tears started coming down my face. Because even though I always tell you that you matter, up until that moment, I didn’t feel like I mattered.”

“My mother.  She had me when she was 18 years old, and my father left when I was one year old, so I never really knew him.  Like a lot of single moms, she had to struggle to work, and eventually she also struggled to go to school.  And she’s really the person who instilled in me a sense of confidence and a sense that I could do anything.  She eventually went on to get her PhD.  It took her ten years, but she did it, and I watched her grind through it.   And as I got older, like everyone else, I realized that my mother wasn’t all that different than me.  She had her own doubts, and fears, and she wasn’t always sure of the right way of doing things.  So to see her overcome tough times was very inspiring.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","THE GREAT HONY ART MYSTERY:

Forgive the sensational title, but I don’t think I’ll get a chance to use it again, so I had to take advantage of the opportunity.  Nearly two weeks ago, I posted this picture of Dwight Williams, an artist that I discovered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  In the caption, Dwight discussed his struggles as an artist.  The comment section was initially supportive, but later turned quite divisive, as allegations began to emerge that Dwight was a fraud.  People claimed that Dwight merely pretended to work on finished, copied prints, only to sell them as originals.  Another person claimed to have purchased Dwight’s work, used an eraser on it, and discovered that it was a “shaded over print.”  Other people posted photos they’d taken of Dwight, several years apart, working on what appeared to be a finished version of the same work.  Lastly, some employees at the Met chimed in, claiming it was “common knowledge” among longtime employees that Dwight sold finished, fraudulent prints to unsuspecting buyers, while claiming they were originals.

But to complicate matters, there was also evidence in Dwight’s favor.  Before taking his photo, or even telling him about Humans of New York, I’d offered to purchase the print he was working on for $400.  Dwight had refused, explaining that the work was “not yet finished.”  Additionally, a few commenters claimed that they had worked with Dwight, and had seen him create a piece from start to finish.  Others claimed to know him personally, and vouched for his talent and skill.

In light of these conflicting reports, I considered the idea of revisiting Dwight, and presenting him with these accusations, but I decided against it.  As with every subject who appears on HONY, Dwight’s story was presented as he told it.  There are plenty of sites that trade in “embarrassing” and “exposing” people, and I didn’t feel a desire to go down that path in a ruthless search for  “The Truth.”  But when Dwight emailed me a few days ago, inviting me to investigate further, I took him up on the offer.  In describing what I found, I will couple my own observations with quotes from a statement that Dwight gave me, which is copied in full in the comments.  

Dwight begins his process with what he calls “ghost images,” or inochromes, which are extremely faint reproductions of Dwight’s original work.  (Documentation of these can be found in the comments).  As he explains, “the images are so light that at least half or more of the details are invisible and must be drawn again.”  Dwight does this because, given the time he puts into each drawing, it is “economically infeasible” to create each work new.  He spends 2-3 days adding details to the original ghost images, which, when completed, “have more realism, skill, and detail than even the original drawing from which they were taken.”  

Dwight says he is “not guiltless.”  Dwight acknowledges that he tells prospective buyers that he creates his work “from scratch.”  He makes this claim because he believes the creation of an ionochrome to be part of an original, complete process.  But Dwight acknowledges that this “technical truth” may have created a false impression with some buyers.  However, he asks that those who have previously purchased his works to please treasure them in the knowledge that he labored greatly to render each and every one of them in as much detail as possible.   

Again, Dwight’s full statement is included in the comments.","2015-03-03T20:51:47+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/899355260138575/?type=3","102099916530784_899355316805236",66407,1980,1272

The crowd made me so nervous that I laid down in the middle of the race and started crying.  At the age of three, he took me to an ice skating rink, hung my crutches on the wall, and pushed me around on a skate.  When I got older, we ran a 5k together every year on Father’s Day.

It wasn’t about your talent.  It’s not that you’re bad or you’re good.  Most likely, the casting director already had a person in their head they were looking for—and you weren’t it.  Or even worse, the role had already been filled, and they were just holding auditions to follow protocol.  Even when you get chosen for a role, success is so fickle and fleeting.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Dave Isay, the founder of StoryCorps, recently won the TED Prize, and stated that his wish was for everyone in the world to record a meaningful interview with a loved one, acquaintance, or even a stranger.  StoryCorps released a free app that helps in that process.  It makes it super easy to create a great interview by selecting from a list of thought-provoking questions.  Some questions I recognized as ones that I also ask.  Some I hadn't thought of before, and look forward to trying in the future.  The app automatically records, stores, and uploads the interview. 

If you're a parent or teacher, I think this is such a great tool to create a project around in order to expand the horizons of your children.  I'd recommend adding the extra element of using the app to interview a stranger.  Engaging a stranger in a meaningful conversation can be very intimidating, and the growth that comes from the exercise can be substantial.  

I think Dave's mission is a noble one, and I want to encourage everyone to download the StoryCorps app.  If nothing else, it can give you ideas for prompts to make your everyday conversations more meaningful.

Later that afternoon we were preparing Marwa for a CT scan, and her sister was helping to take out her hair extensions.  Suddenly Marwa sat up really fast, and she looked so scared, like she’d seen a ghost.  She fell toward me and I took her in my arms and she started having a seizure.  The doctors pulled me away and I started fighting with them, but they wheeled Marwa away to the ICU.  They told me it would be fine, and I could go home, but I slept in the waiting room, and that night the doctor called my cellphone and said ‘Come now.’  When I got to the ICU, they told me, ‘We lost her for a bit, and if she comes back now, we don’t know how much of her will come back.”  It didn’t feel real.  It was like the movies.  I was standing right over her and her heart rate monitor would go flat, and these two huge men would start hammering her in the chest, and she was so tiny, and her heart would beat for a couple more minutes and then it would go flat again.  And then I heard the doctor say ‘Let’s give it one last try.’  And then I heard the doctor say ‘Time of death.’  And then he turned to me and said, ‘We’ll leave you here.  Take all the time you need.’  And when they left me alone, I was like a madman.  I didn’t know what to do.  I started taking photos of her hands, and her feet, and I cut off bits of her hair.

But soon afterward his language stopped developing, and eventually he lost the language skills he already had.  He stopped responding to his name.  You could even bang pots and pans behind him, and he wouldn’t respond.  But when we tested his hearing, it was fine.  People would say: ‘Boys develop later.’  Or ‘Don’t worry, my daughter didn’t begin talking until she was three.”  But we knew it was something more.  This was twenty years ago, so the doctors didn’t even know what to tell us.  The head of pediatrics at Columbia met with us, and said: ‘Let me do some research on autism and I’ll get back to you.’  We started to worry that Jackson might never progress.  Around this time, I overheard some acquaintances worrying that their four-year-old son might be gay.  It made me so mad.  I thought:  ‘Give me a fucking break.  You know that your child can grow to be happy, independent, and fall in love.

Everyone is needy, and when you have a special needs child, it’s hard to give everyone the attention they deserve.  I wish I could have given my other two children more parenting.  And I wish my wife and I had more time to focus on each other.  But sometimes we were too busy with Jackson.  It could be like crisis mode all the time.  I’d be fighting the school board.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","About two years ago today, the final touches were being put on the first HONY book.  The book was the culmination of three years of hard work, and I couldn’t be prouder of how it turned out.  But in the months and years that followed, the blog has continued to evolve.  The interviews have become much deeper.  The stories have grown longer and more intimate.  And while the first book is a colorful depiction of HONY’s beginnings, it doesn’t fully represent what HONY has become.  So I’m very excited to announce that ‘Humans of New York: Stories’ will be published this October.  It will be 432 pages of the best material from the past 2.5 years.  Additionally, it will feature 100 stories that have never been seen before.  I’m putting the finishing touches on the manuscript over the next couple weeks, and am so thrilled to have a book that finally represents what HONY has become.

And I just happened to walk in the wrong door. And in that room I saw homeless families waiting to be processed. Some were sleeping on plastic chairs. There were babies sleeping on bare mattresses. Some didn’t have diapers. I ran to the store and bought bread, peanut butter, and apple juice for everyone. Then I used the three quarters left in my pocket to call The New York Times and The Red Cross. Ever since then, I’ve been an advocate for the homeless.”

He was the oldest brother in a family of four who were housed in a nearby shelter. When he came to us, his father had just committed suicide by drinking Clorox in Central Park. His father had been mentally ill, and before he killed himself, he had told the boy that he’d kill him too. So the boy kept having dreams. He kept dreaming that his father was Uncle Scar, and he was coming to kill him. He became obsessed with The Lion King. He stopped going to school. He stopped looking at people. When you approached him, you couldn’t move too quickly, or he’d be terrified. But we started working with him, and he started to improve. We discovered that he was an ace at math. And all these years later, I just ran into him on the street. He was 6 foot 5’ and buttoned up in a suit! He seemed very happy and has a great job at an embassy now.”

All the girls were in one room and all the boys were in another room.

I want this support group to be a safe place for ex-felons to begin to feel vulnerable again. I want them to learn that they can express vulnerability, and experience the joys and disappointments of other people without getting hurt. If they can’t learn to express their vulnerability in relationships, they will end up back in prison. They’ll become isolated from their families because those relationships were built on deception, instead of trust. They’ll choose to express their vulnerabilities through drug use, or violence. They might even strike back at their boss when they’re reprimanded at work. The goal is to provide them with a safe platform to express their emotions before they’re filled up.”

The only thing you have is your social standing. And if your social standing in jail is perceived as higher than that on the outside, sometimes it’s preferable to go back. In prison, they called me ‘Pops.’ I got privileges. People respected me. I felt valued. When I got out, I had to start over.”

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Brandon,

You photographed my wife Megan and me on New Years Eve in 2013, on fifth avenue. We were on our way from the opera to ring in 2014 at the 21 club.  When you shared our photo on your site, your caption was that we met in Austria, on a train, in the snow.

On Monday Megan gave birth to our daughter Lotte (our first child), who had been diagnosed with a serious congenital heart defect (HLHS). On Thursday she underwent open heart surgery for nine hours. Although the procedure was technically a success, an unexpected complication prevented them from taking off the heart lung bypass in the OR. The surgeon made an unprecedented decision to keep her on ECMO (life support) for a few days to allow her heart to rest, so that they could try again to restart it.

She has basically been in stable condition, but over night developed some complications that necessitate trying to start weaning her off the machine today. I have no words to describe the torture we feel as parents, when all we can do is sit by our daughter's beside, trying not to look at the tubes and wires coming out of her open chest, and holding her cold little hand. I had two magical days with Lotte, who before the surgery was basically a ""normal"" baby. We got to touch her, feed her, change her, and we're so lucky to even see her open her eyes. I'm not a religious person so I've not prayed, but I constantly close my eyes and picture Lotte with her beautiful eyes open. I'm not sure I'll ever see those eyes again, but I'm so thankful that I have them in my mind.

I wanted to ask whether you could somehow help us increase awareness of pediatric congenital heart disease, which is sadly not widely known and publicized. It's especially hard for Megan that today is Mother's Day, and perhaps you could share a photo of Lotte on your site. Doing so would not only inform your readers of this important and terrible condition, but help us hear the support of others.

Thank you so much.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Dear Brandon,

Early last night Lotte suffered a brain hemorrhage, and it became clear that her mounting medical problems and the growing risk of additional complications made the chances of her recovering and leading a life of sound body and mind less and less likely. Out of love for her, Megan and I made the terrible decision to discontinue the artificial support of her life on ECMO. It was the hardest thing we have ever had to do, but we feel comforted knowing that she never suffered, and that we bore all of her pain. Had she lived and become aware of her medical condition we couldn't have continued to do so, and weren't willing to force her into a life of perpetual suffering and  struggle. We'll never forget the three magical days we had with our daughter, and though we are grieving profoundly, know that she will be with us forever in spirit. Someday we will tell her siblings about their wonderful older sister Lotte, whom we loved so much.

Since Lotte's story has evoked such an outpouring of kindness, I wonder whether you would share the end of the story with your readers. As an image, perhaps you could share this photo of her footprints, which one of the social workers made the day before he surgery. She will walk with us forever.

A few days ago we were eating breakfast, and a cartoon came on the television, and she said: ‘I wish we’d had a child.’  Then we started talking about adoption a little bit.

I’ve battled it off-and-on my whole life, but two years ago the wheels just completely came off.  I’d just had a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner with my friends, and I went to sleep in a good mood, but then the next day I couldn’t get out of bed.  I was still in bed four days later when my boss started calling.   The next two years were a battle.  I lost my job.  I was hospitalized three times.  I filled a giant binder with information about depression, where to find programs, and how to appeal your insurance company.  I felt like I was fighting for my life.  I’d call a hospital that specialized in a certain type of therapy, and they’d tell me they didn’t take my insurance.  I’d say: ‘Please help me.  I’m dying.’”","2015-05-20T21:14:22+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/976619599078807/?type=3","102099916530784_976619599078807",157631,5370,13814

My head was filled with thoughts like, ‘If my friends knew who I really was, they wouldn’t love me.’  And, ‘What right do I have to exist?’  And, eventually, ‘Why do any of us have the right to exist?’  If people were being kind to me, I wasn’t able to access that kindness.  It wouldn’t produce a feeling in me.  If a child smiled at me from a stroller, it might lift me up for a millisecond, but then I’d fall back into darkness.  Before I was depressed, I could find joy in things so easily.  I worked as a gardener, and I learned the calls of the birds so I could tell where they were just by listening.  I loved to show new plants and insects to children, and see how excited they’d get.  I made a 50th birthday card for my sister, and got strangers from all over the world to write ‘Happy Birthday’ in their language.  But during my depression, I couldn’t access any of that joy.  I’d try reminding myself that other people had bigger problems.  I’d try telling myself to quit being weak, and to snap out of it.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I was hoping you guys could help me with an experiment.  I think we can collaborate to make Humans of New York much more interesting.  As you know, Facebook has engineered the comment section to be collaborative.  The comments are ordered by amount of ‘likes,’ so the community votes on which comments rise to the top.  That means as a group, we can work together to make the comment section more powerful and impactful.  

Under the current system, the first comments have a huge advantage.  Hastily written comments are seen far more often than more thoughtful comments that took longer to write.  I think we could really improve the discussion if we worked together to overcome this.  If you’d like to help, try changing your comment ordering from ‘Most Relevant’ to ‘Most Recent.’  You can help discover people who took extra time to write a thoughtful and carefully constructed comment.  By ‘liking’ these comments, you’ll allow them to be appreciated by the entire community.  Even if a few hundred people decided to help in this way, millions of people would benefit from the valuable insights that would otherwise be buried.  

Even if you don’t have time to sift through most recent comments, you can still help to enrich the discussion.  HONY is all about stories.  As a community, let’s try to ‘like’ comments from people sharing insights or similar experiences.  There is nothing wrong with comments like ‘her hair is awesome,’ or ‘she looks much younger than 50.’  Those comments are kind, supportive, and appreciated.  But I think it would make Humans of New York more interesting if we could work together to prioritize stories over opinions.  If there’s anything I’ve learned from doing HONY these past five years, it’s that stories are always more interesting than opinions.

Anyway—it’s just an experiment.  Nothing NEEDS to be fixed.  HONY’s comment section may be the nicest place on the Internet.  I just wonder if we can make it even better.  If we could figure out how to raise the most thoughtful comments to the top, we could further benefit from the experiences and insights of the community.  Even if we improve the quality of the discussion by 5%, that would have a huge impact over time.  

Thanks everyone.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","‘HONY: Stories’ is being released on October 13th, which is just over three months away!   The first book represented HONY during its teenage years.  Now HONY is a fully formed adult—with less acne, a full beard, and that embarrassing misdemeanor charge from Spring Break expunged from our record.   ‘HONY: Stories’ will be filled with the quotes that have come to define the blog in the last few years.  These were largely absent from the first book, not because I chose to exclude them, but because they didn’t quite exist yet.  Lastly, at 432 pages, ‘HONY: Stories’ is 100 pages longer than the first book, with a great deal of exclusive material.  And we’ve managed to keep the same price because we are printing quite a few of them. 

ANYWAY, I was going to post this little reminder after the holiday weekend. But I noticed this morning that Amazon has just marked the book down 48% for some reason, so if you’d like to preorder now, you can get it for $15.70.  I’ve been glancing at the price every few days, and it’s always changing, but this is by far the lowest I’ve seen.  I’m hoping it will last through the day.  (Because of Amazon’s price guarantee, anyone who has already ordered the book will get the same price.)  Thanks everyone! And have a great holiday. 

Edit:  As of 12:30 PM EST, Amazon has changed the status of the book to 'Currently Unavailable,' a status which I've never seen before.  Hopefully it will be back up shortly.  Perhaps we enraged them with our Sherlockesque price sleuthing.

It doesn’t mean you can’t have nice things.   I’ve got a nice flat screen TV at home, great furniture, a sauna, sporting goods, and all the clothes I can wear.  Conservation just means that you aren’t constantly getting rid of perfectly good stuff to replace it with stuff that you don’t need.  A perfect table is perfect for hundreds of years.  You don’t need a new one every couple years.  Our culture is called ‘materialistic,’ but that’s not even correct, because ‘materialism’ implies that we value our possessions.  And we don’t.  We get rid of them, then we destroy Africa to get more shit that nobody needs.  There’s no more pressing problem right now than the depletion of the earth.  The earth can tolerate a lot of punishment, but if there isn’t a change in the way we consume, there is no way it can survive.  We will gladly give money help people in need.

With all the work he put into us, I should have accomplished more.  But I was responsible for my own destruction.  He sent me to one of the best high schools in the city, but he was always at work.  So I had no supervision and all I did was play video games.  He worked so hard for me and I didn’t even study.  But my son will be different.  He’s going to be an important man.”

Violence is used to silence journalists, and judges, and moderate religious scholars.   And it seems to be getting worse.  Every time I see somebody on television speaking out in anger against extremism or corruption—I’ll say a prayer for them.  And every time one of those people is murdered, those of us who aspire to be like them grow a little more afraid.  So it’s not that the reports of violence are false.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I want to conclude the Pakistan series by spotlighting a very special change agent who is working to eradicate one of the nation’s most pressing social ills.  Over 20,000 brick kilns operate in Pakistan, supported by millions of workers, and the system is largely underpinned by an extremely close cousin of slavery—bonded labor.  Throughout rural Pakistan, illiterate and desperate laborers are tricked into accepting small loans in exchange for agreeing to work at brick kilns for a small period of time.  But due to predatory terms, their debt balloons, growing larger as time goes on, with no possibility of repayment, until these laborers are condemned to work for the rest of their lives for no compensation.  If the laborer dies, the debt is passed on to his or her children.  The practice is illegal.  But due to the extreme power and wealth of brick kiln owners, the law is often unenforced in rural areas.  It is estimated that well over one million men, women, and children are trapped in this modern feudalist system.

Meet Syeda Ghulam Fatima.  Described as a modern day Harriet Tubman, Fatima has devoted her life to ending bonded labor.  She has been shot, electrocuted, and beaten numerous times for her activism.  Quite literally, she places herself between the workers and their owners.  The organization she leads, the Bonded Labour Liberation Front, is small but determined.  It is working to set up Freedom Centers throughout rural Pakistan so that every bonded laborer has access to advocacy and legal aid.  Fatima operates on a very small budget.  So as we learn her story over the next few days, anyone wishing to help empower Fatima can donate to Bonded Labour Liberation Front here:

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","“Bricks are the primary unit of construction across Pakistan.  They are cheaper than concrete so almost everything is made with brick-- especially in rural areas.  There are 20,000 brick kilns across the country.  We estimate that an average of 40 families work on each of these kilns and that each family is required to make 1000 bricks per day.  That means 4.5 million people are living in slavery conditions.  And so many of these workers are young children.  Often they work all day and are denied education.  They work in isolated areas, shielded from the eyes of society and hidden from the protection of the constitution.  The laws don’t reach the kilns, so the workers live in constant fear of violence and retribution.  The kiln owners are so rich and powerful.  Their profits represent nearly 3% of Pakistan’s GDP.  They put their friends and relatives in the legislature.  They bribe and intimidate the police.  It is very dangerous to speak out against them.  I’ve been attacked and threatened so many times that I no longer fear death.”

This is the second post in a series on Syeda Ghulam Fatima.  Known to her admirers as Pakistan’s Harriet Tubman, Fatima has worked tirelessly to eradicate bonded labor—one of the last remaining forms of modern slavery.  She has been electrocuted, shot, and repeatedly beaten for her activism.  Despite her outsized impact, she operates on a very small budget.  So we are raising money for the organization that Fatima leads: the Bonded Labour Liberation Front.  US Dollars can be leveraged for so much impact in Pakistan.  Your donation will go very far.

Then they knocked me to the ground, pulled back my leg, and shot me in the knee.  Afterwards they did the same to my brother.  We thought we were dead.  I was taken to the public hospital but was turned away.  Politicians from the local ruling party had forbidden the doctors from treating me.  The assailants were never prosecuted.  I had to sell my house to afford treatment at a private hospital.  But the brick kiln workers came together to try to help me pay for my treatment.  Despite their poverty, they gave 5 to 10 rupees at a time.  And they lined up to donate their blood.”

This is the third post in a series on Syeda Ghulam Fatima. Known to her admirers as Pakistan’s Harriet Tubman, Fatima has worked tirelessly to eradicate bonded labor—one of the last remaining forms of modern slavery. She has been electrocuted, shot, and repeatedly beaten for her activism. Despite her outsized impact, she operates on a very small budget. So we are raising money to help her in her mission.  As is clear from her story, Fatima puts 100% of her own resources, both physical and financial, into her activism.  Every dollar donated will have significant impact.  There is no better way to impact the battle against modern slavery than empowering one of its most forceful opponents: http://bit.ly/1N9W3Ts","2015-08-16T21:35:02+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1056107757796657/?type=3","102099916530784_1056107757796657",232756,3451,22207

The owners called me to the office and beat me.  They made the other workers join in.  Then they took off all my clothes and tied me to a tree.  I begged them not to do it.  They left me there for hours.  I tried to escape at night.  I padlocked my family in the house and I ran into the fields.  I came straight to Fatima.  Before we could return for my family, the police had helped the owners break into my house.  And my daughters were paraded naked in the streets.”

This is the fourth post in a series on Syeda Ghulam Fatima.  Known to her admirers as Pakistan’s Harriet Tubman, Fatima has worked tirelessly to eradicate bonded labor—one of the last remaining forms of modern slavery.  This man is one of millions of bonded laborers in Pakistan, and one of the tens of thousands who has turned directly to Fatima to help him escape the violence and cruelty of the owners.  Fatima has been electrocuted, shot, and repeatedly beaten for her activism. Despite her outsized impact, she operates on a very small budget. So we are raising money to help her in her mission.

Today is the last day of the fundraiser we are holding for Fatima’s organization, The Bonded Labour Liberation Front.  We have raised nearly $250,000 so far.  Costs are low in Pakistan, so this sort of money can be leveraged many times over.  We are not just increasing Fatima’s abilities to help free people from bondage.  We are MULTIPLYING those abilities.  Nearly 8,000 people have contributed so far.  I encourage everyone to read the previous posts, and consider being counted in our effort to aid Fatima’s fight against modern slavery: http://bit.ly/1N9W3Ts","2015-08-17T14:55:54+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1056641241076642/?type=3","102099916530784_1056641241076642",101970,3734,14854

They only pay you 200 rupees per 1000 bricks, and it all goes to them, and the debt keeps growing.  We are supposed to work from dawn to dusk for six days a week, but we never get the 7th day off.  They tell me I owe them 900,000 rupees now.  There is no hope for me.  Every year they have a market.  The brick kiln owners get together and they sell us to each other.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Yesterday 40,000 people donated over $1,000,000 in fewer than 12 hours to help Fatima end bonded labor.  The fundraiser currently sits at almost $1,400,000.  There were no perks offered.  No ‘reward levels.’  This was motivated by nothing more than genuine compassion and a desire to empower a woman who’s devoted her life to freeing people trapped in modern slavery.   Thank you so much.  Fatima has prepared a statement that I will post shortly.   

I want to conclude this series with a story that will show you the character of the person you’ve just empowered.  This is one of thousands of anecdotes that reveal a person who is more committed to humanity than to her own safety or comfort:

Recently a family trapped in bonded labor got in touch with Fatima.  They told her that they could not escape their owners, and that the girls in the family were being sexually abused by the owners.  Fatima immediately jumped in her car and drove to the kiln in the middle of the night.  She told the family to run.  The owners woke up and began to fire guns.  The family reached the car, but the youngest girl—only four years old--- had fallen down and been captured.

For three months the child was missing.  Fatima went to court and begged for intervention, but the police kept insisting that they’d searched the kiln, and no child could be found.  “I couldn’t sleep,” explains Fatima.  “Every night I laid in bed and could think about nothing but this young girl in the hands of her brutalizers.  I stayed awake all night thinking about how I could rescue her.”

Fatima recruited several other laborers to help her.  Dressed in rags, they went to the kiln and pretended to be workers.  They spent several days searching.  They couldn’t find the girl anywhere.  But from the owner’s house, they heard constant crying.  They went back to the court and demanded that the house be investigated.  The girl was found.  But for weeks, she would not eat, talk, or cry.  Fatima eventually learned that every time the girl would cry for food, the owner would beat her.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","Before this fundraiser, Fatima had exhausted her financial resources in the struggle against bonded labor to the point where she feared that she'd be unable to pay her own medical bills.  Thanks to everyone who donated over the past 72 hours, she now has nearly $2 million to continue her organization's fight against bonded labor.  (To fully visualize this impact, it should be realized that the purchasing power of a dollar in Pakistan is about 5x greater than in the United States.)  This is an absolutely transformational amount of money.  Fatima is meeting with the board of the BLLF to plan a major expansion of their efforts, and she wanted me to pass along this statement:

""From BLLF and from all of the bonded labourers, thank you. Thank you to everyone who has opened their hearts and donated to our cause. I struggle to find the words, I don't think I have the words to tell you how grateful we are. You have donated for freedom, for rehabilitation and we are indebted. Thank you so much. The prayers of every labourer are with you and they will always hold you in their hearts. Our responsibility now is to honour what you have trusted us with, and we will. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we want to build a real freedom center in Lahore, here we can work on not just releasing families but rehabilitation. We want workers to be treated with the rights they deserve as citizens.

Pakistan faces a lot of challenges, and we want industry to thrive in Pakistan, but the labourers must be free. You cannot make people work by beating and chaining them. I believe that the day the owners understand me, that the day the worker is happy, the profits will be greater. Labour rights need to be regulated, owners have the right to make profit but not through abuse, and deprivation. That is not an industry, that is slavery.

This is a big step for labourers that this has received so much attention, and that their voices have reached a global stage and we are being heard. With this we hope to end bonded labour in Pakistan.""","2015-08-18T19:15:44+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1057545407652892/?type=3","102099916530784_1057545407652892",255863,5647,18142
"102099916530784","Humans of New York","A Final Word On Pakistan:

Imagine that every time you have a lapse in judgment, it gets printed in newspapers around the world: every time you lose patience with your children, every time you scream at someone in traffic, every time you drink too much and do something you regret.  Each time you slip up, everyone hears about it.  The world is never notified about the 99.99% of the time that you are a completely normal, productive, law-abiding citizen.  The world only learns about you when things go wrong.  Now imagine what the world would think of you.

It’s not that terrorism, patriarchy, and violence aren’t real problems in Pakistan.  They exist and the country is battling these issues every single day.  Pakistanis are very much aware of the extremism in their midst.  The problem is that so many people seem to only be aware of that extremism.  Because just as in the hypothetical example above—the other 99.99% of life just doesn’t make the news.  When there’s only room in the newspaper for a single column about Pakistan, it’s going to be filled with the most compelling story.  And unfortunately, that tends to be the most violent story.

And those are important stories.  Those are the types of stories that expose corruption, stop genocide, and alert the world to emerging threats.  It’s right for those stories to be told.  But when those stories are all that we hear, it’s so easy to imagine a world that’s far scarier than it really is.  You lose sight of the 99.99% of the world that’s not scary at all.  And living in fear can be a dangerous thing. Because if we’re afraid of each other, we’ll never be able to work together to solve our common problems.","2015-08-19T00:59:48+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1057794727627960/?type=3","102099916530784_1057794727627960",522562,16214,107665

At night we’d huddle around the stove for warmth.  We lived in a bad neighborhood, so we knew what was going on.  We even knew where the crack house was.  We’d walk down the street to see if our mom’s car was parked out front.  We ate whatever we could find.  Some days it was just cereal and sardines.  We shared what we had.  My younger brother was the hustler.  He was nine.  He’d knock on doors in the neighborhood, looking for jobs.  He mowed lawns, raked leaves, shoveled snow.  Then he’d always share his money with us to buy food.  But a lot of times our mom would take it for herself.  One time my mom brought us home a dog.  We pooled all our money together to buy it food, and took care of it for awhile.  But it got sick one day, and we didn’t know what to do, and we couldn’t find our mom.  So it died.”

My grandmother finally rescued us from her right before I went into middle school.  When we got taken away, my mother really went off the deep end.  We never heard from her.  There was a lot of resentment from my side.  It was an awkward age.  And whenever there were events at school and my friends brought their parents, I’d get angry all over again. Things started to change when I was 15.  I got a really bad case of the West Nile Virus and I almost died, and suddenly Mom got serious about rehab.  She didn’t laugh it off anymore.  She’d call and talk about the things she was learning in her counseling sessions.  She’d tell me about the milestones she reached.  She finally got clean and now we’re best friends.  We talk every day.  Out of all my siblings, I’ve been the most forgiving.  I think it was easiest for me because I managed to separate the addiction from the person.  Even with how bad it got, and with everything she put us through, there was never a moment that I doubted she loved us.”

The book is pretty massive.  It’s 43% larger than the first book and includes more of everything.  There are tons of the richer and more mature stories that have emerged over the last couple of years.  Plus there are over 100 exclusive stories, which have never been seen and are among my favorites.  HONY Stories is the result of thousands of hours of work.  And I won’t say it’s perfect.  But I’m pretty sure it’s as perfect of a book as I’m capable of making at this point in my life.  

To top it all off, we managed to keep it at the same price as the last book.  ($29.99)  You can preorder now for 30% off, and it will be on your doorstep next month!

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","I want to begin this refugee series with a post from the summer of 2014.  This is Muhammad, who I first met last year in Iraqi Kurdistan.  At the time, he had just fled the war in Syria and was working as a clerk at my hotel.  When war broke out, he’d been studying English Literature at the University of Damascus, so his English was nearly perfect.  He agreed to work as my interpreter and we spent several days interviewing refugees who were fleeing the advance of ISIS.   As is evident from the quote below, I left Muhammad with the expectation that he’d soon be travelling to the United Kingdom with fake papers.  I am retelling the story because I have just now reconnected with Muhammad.  He will be working again as my interpreter for the next ten days.  But the story he told me of what happened since we last met is tragic.  (1/6)

""The fighting got very bad. When I left Syria to come here, I only had $50. I was almost out of money when I got here. I met a man on the street, who took me home, and gave me food and a place to stay. But I felt so ashamed to be in his home that I spent 11 hours a day looking for jobs, and only came back to sleep. I finally found a job at a hotel. They worked me 12 hours a day, for 7 days a week. They gave me $400 a month. Now I found a new hotel now that is much better. I work 12 hours per day for $600 a month, and I get one day off. In all my free hours, I work at a school as an English teacher. I work 18 hours per day, every day. And I have not spent any of it. I have not bought even a single T-shirt. I've saved 13,000 Euro, which is how much I need to buy fake papers. There is a man I know who can get me to Europe for 13,000. I'm leaving next week. I'm going once more to Syria to say goodbye to my family, then I'm going to leave all this behind. I'm going to try to forget it all. And I'm going to finish my education.""

I slept in my uncle’s barn the entire time I was there, because every day the police were knocking on my father’s door.  Eventually my father told me: ‘If you stay any longer, they will find you and they will kill you.’  So I contacted a smuggler and made my way to Istanbul.  I was just about to leave for Europe when I received a call from my sister.  She told me that my father had been very badly beaten by police, and unless I sent 5,000 Euro for an operation, he would die.  That was my money to get to Europe.  But what could I do?  I had no choice.  Then two weeks later she called with even worse news.  My brother had been killed by ISIS while he was working in an oil field.  They found our address on his ID card, and they sent his head to our house, with a message: ‘Kurdish people aren’t Muslims.’  My youngest sister found my brother’s head.  This was one year ago.  She has not spoken a single word since.” (Kos, Greece)

My father was in intensive care, and every day my sisters called and told me that ISIS was getting closer to our village.  I went completely crazy.  I fainted in the street one day and woke up in the hospital.  I gave the rest of my money to a smuggler to help my sisters escape to Iraq.  Now I only had 1000 Euro left and I was stranded in Turkey.  My father recovered from his operation at this time.  He called me and asked how I’d paid for his surgery.

He acted like he cared very much and wanted to help me.  He told me that for 1000 Euros, he could get me to a Greek Island.  He said: ‘I’m not like the other smugglers.  I fear God.  I have children of my own.  Nothing bad will happen to you.’  I trusted this man.  One night he called me and told me to meet him at a garage.  He put me in the back of a van with twenty other people.  There were tanks of gasoline back there, and we couldn’t breath.  People started to scream and vomit.  The smuggler pulled out a gun, pointed it at us, and said: ‘If you don’t shut up, I will kill you.’  He took us to a beach, and while he prepared the boat, his partner kept the gun pointed at us.  The boat was made of plastic and was only three meters long.  When we got on it, everyone panicked and the boat started to sink.  Thirteen of the people were too scared to go.  But the smuggler said that if we changed our minds, he would keep the money, so seven of us decided to go ahead.  The smuggler told us that he would guide us to the island, but after a few hundred meters, he jumped off the boat and swam to shore.  He told us to keep going straight.  The waves got higher and higher and water began to come in the boat.  It was completely black.  We could see no land, no lights, only ocean.  Then after thirty minutes the motor stopped.  I knew we all would die.  I was so scared that my thoughts completely stopped.  The women started crying because none of them could swim.  I lied and told them that I could swim with three people on my back.  It started to rain.  The boat began to turn in circles.  Everyone was so frightened that nobody could speak.  But one man kept trying to work on the motor, and after a few minutes it started again.  I don’t remember how we reached shore.  But I remember I kissed all the earth I could find.  I hate the sea now.  I hate it so much.  I don’t like to swim it.  I don’t like to look at it.  I hate everything about it.”  (Kos, Greece)

We began to walk toward the police station to register as refugees.  We even asked a man on the side of the road to call the police for us.  I told the other refugees to let me speak for them, since I spoke English.  Suddenly two police jeeps came speeding toward us and slammed on the brakes.  They acted like we were murderers and they’d been searching for us.  They pointed guns at us and screamed: ‘Hands up!’  I told them: ‘Please, we just escaped the war, we are not criminals!’  They said: ‘Shut up, Malaka!’  I will never forget this word:  ‘Malaka, Malaka, Malaka.’  It was all they called us.  They threw us into prison.  Our clothes were wet and we could not stop shivering.  We could not sleep.  I can still feel this cold in my bones.  For three days we had no food or water.  I told the police: ‘We don’t need food, but please give us water.’  I begged the commander to let us drink.  Again, he said: ‘Shut up, Malaka!’  I will remember this man’s face for the rest of my life.  He had a gap in his teeth so he spit on us when he spoke.  He chose to watch seven people suffer from thirst for three days while they begged him for water.  We were saved when they finally they put us on a boat and sent us to a camp on the mainland.  For twelve days we stayed there before walking north.  We walked for three weeks.  I ate nothing but leaves.  Like an animal.  We drank from dirty rivers.  My legs grew so swollen that I had to take off my shoes.  When we reached the border, an Albanian policeman found us and asked if we were refugees.  When we told him ‘yes,’ he said that he would help us.  He told us to hide in the woods until nightfall.  I did not trust this man, but I was too tired to run.  When night came, he loaded us all into his car.  Then he drove us to his house and let us stay there for one week.  He bought us new clothes.  He fed us every night.  He told me: ‘Do not be ashamed.

He took me to the Rotary Club and introduced me to the entire group.  He told them my story and asked: ‘How can we help him?’  I found a church, and they gave me a place to live.  Right away I committed myself to learning the language.  I practiced German for 17 hours a day.  I read children's stories all day long.  I watched television.  I tried to meet as many Austrians as possible.  After seven months, it was time to meet with a judge to determine my status.  I could speak so well at this point, that I asked the judge if we could conduct the interview in German.  He couldn't believe it.

"102099916530784","Humans of New York","For context on the upcoming stories, it is important to understand the ‘plastic boat.’  The plastic boat is a central figure in the story of almost every refugee coming to Europe via Turkey.  Every day, thousands of people arrive to the Greek islands on these boats.  They represent one of the only ways that refugees can bypass immigration restrictions and throw themselves at the feet of Europe.  The journey is extremely dangerous and many have drowned in the past few months.  Despite paying Turkish smugglers $1500 per person, the refugees are loaded into boats that are filled to many times their capacity.  The boats usually leave at night to avoid detection.  Often the refugees arrive carrying nothing but horror stories.  Unfortunately there is little waiting for them on the other side.  If they are lucky, a handful of volunteers will meet them on the beach with a bottle of water.  In Lesvos, where this photo was taken, the refugees will then begin a 50-mile walk to the port where they can register.  The UNHCR and several NGOs are scrambling to provide bare necessities, but their resources are stretched to capacity.  They can offer little beyond a guarantee of survival.  The initial elation of the refugees at having reached Europe will quickly subside as many realize they cannot even afford the price of a ferry to get off the island.","2015-09-28T15:46:27+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1097460370328062/?type=3","102099916530784_1097460370328062",100039,2134,13711

Both the lower compartment and the deck were filled with people.  Waves began to come into the boat so the captain told everyone to throw their baggage into the sea.  In the ocean we hit a rock, but the captain told us not to worry.  Water began to come into the boat, but again he told us not to worry.  We were in the lower compartment and it began to fill with water.  It was too tight to move.  Everyone began to scream.  We were the last ones to get out alive.

I hope that you’ve learned along with me that each refugee carries a tragically unique story often filled with violence and fear.  Many of you have asked about the best way to help.  There are plenty of wonderful NGOs working to assist refugees, but you cannot go wrong supporting the UNHCR.  Money donated to the UNHCR goes directly to providing food, water, and shelter to desperate people.  The UNHCR is on the ground all over the world, often in dangerous and difficult places, providing essentials to people who have no government or state to protect them.  This is why the UNHCR has won two Nobel Peace Prizes.  Currently the resources of the UNHCR are stretched to the limit, and sometimes the organization is only able to make a tissue thin difference.  But often it is the difference between life and death.

Quite wonderfully and coincidentally, Kickstarter launched a campaign this morning to support the UNHCR.  It’s the very first charity campaign that Kickstarter has ever done.  I encourage anyone wishing to make a difference in the refugee crisis to donate there: https://www.kickstarter.com/aidrefugees","2015-10-06T22:10:37+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1103830189691080/?type=3","102099916530784_1103830189691080",160992,2781,21913

So I want to take a quick opportunity to remind everyone that HONY is advertisement free and almost entirely financed by book sales.  (The only exception being income from a handful of speeches I give every year.)  Proceeds from books have been used to pay for trips to twenty different countries over the past year alone.  Even when working with large organizations like the United Nations or UNHCR, I’m always very careful to cover all costs and reimburse any expenses.  I do this so that the content on HONY can remain entirely independent, self-directed, and transparent.  By purchasing a book, you can help HONY continue to grow in a way that remains focused on telling people’s stories--- and nothing else.  Thanks to everyone for your continued support.

I hallucinated my mother’s voice calling my name.   I heard it very distinctly.  But when I opened my eyes-- it was my nurse Jenny that was calling me.

A lot of times she worked until 8 pm, so my grandfather would always pick me up from elementary school and help me with my homework.  He loved to help me with school because I was his first grandchild to get an education.  He especially loved book reports.  He always insisted that we decorate the cover of the report in case we needed an extra bump in our grade.  If it was a Halloween book report, he’d make a witch out of toilet paper and straws.  He always told me that it was his dream to see me finish college.  But the day before I graduated high school, his hand started shaking and he dropped a bowl of cereal while we were eating breakfast.  It turned out he had a major stroke.  He was minimally responsive after that but we kept him on life support.  We thought if we prayed hard enough and believed enough, he would recover.  He held on for a few years.  I ended up going to the Fashion Institute of Technology, and I’d stop in every once in awhile and tell him about my grades.  Toward the end, he grew very sick and blind, and his body was rejecting food.  I finally graduated from FIT, and I brought him my graduation photos.  Even though he couldn’t see them, I described the graduation to him.

He’s a great father.  He sees the best in people.  He’s not mean.  I can’t really say that we were always happy, because happiness comes in spurts.  Sometimes the stress of your career makes it hard to be a good partner.  Or the disappointment you feel from not achieving personal goals.  But there was never a time that I thought we were going to leave each other.  And even today I still feel those spurts of happiness with him.

Luis will be co-hosting the HONY Stories Book Launch tomorrow night at the Union Square Barnes and Noble.  I don’t want to shoot off ALL our fireworks before the event, but Luis tells me there is a high probability that he will warm up the crowd with at least one knock-knock joke, as well as a particularly challenging brain teaser.  There is also an 87.4 percent probability that Moochie The Guinea Pig will join us on stage.  Luis also claims that he will ‘easily’ sign more books than me, but seeing that it’s a school night, I’m forced to question if he possesses the requisite endurance to back up such wild claims.  We shall see.  The event starts at 6PM, but capacity for the store is 1,000 people.  So Barnes and Noble will be giving out wristbands beginning at 9 AM to anyone who purchases a book.  Looking forward to seeing everyone who can make it.","2015-10-13T17:35:47+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1108083985932367/?type=3","102099916530784_1108083985932367",465893,14831,26048

I didn’t have much income, my credit was bad, and I needed a new place to live.  So I responded to a listing on Craigslist.  And because of my desperation, I ended up living with a hoarder.  I was completely despondent.  So for the next two days, I walked around New York and asked hundreds of people to say a prayer for me.  Or if they didn’t want to pray, I asked them to say something nice to me.  Most people just said: ‘God bless you’ or ‘I hope things work out.’  I asked priests, monks, bank tellers, security guards, homeless people, mentally ill people… everyone.  I’d say that I approached about 200 people.  Then at the end of the two days, a post from a friend popped on my newsfeed.  It said: ‘I have an empty room and need someone to move in today.’  So one of those prayers worked.

We came here because we felt that we’d exhausted all the opportunities in the town that we grew up in.  We’d already built a reputation locally and played in all the bars.  So we decided to move to New York so we could continue growing.  I guess I imagined that there would be a sort of domino effect.  People would hear about us, start coming to our shows, and things would really bloom from there.  But it’s been a much slower process than I expected.  It’s really hard to stand out in the city because there are thousands of bands here competing for attention.

She made me get a $12,000 watch.  She was so concerned with appearances.  She told everyone that her father was a top executive when I knew he was a middle manager.

She had a constant sense of victimhood.  I saw her journal one day, and without going into detail, I will say it seems that she had a very abusive childhood.  But that translated into a non-stop, throbbing anxiety.  She’d pick fights with shopkeepers.  She went through three different dentists.  She made one of them refund her invisible braces because she could see them.  Her friendships would last an average of four months before she manufactured a reason to break them off.  And she’d always try to get me on her side during these feuds.  If I tried to talk reason to her, she’d claim that I was against her too.  One day my mother’s friend was walking behind my wife on the street, and overheard her talking about getting a divorce.  I’d seen up close how vindictive she could be, so I decided to get a lawyer too.  We’d signed a pre-nup, so my lawyer told me that I’d have very little leverage.  And I knew my wife would chisel anything she could from me.  So my lawyer told me: ‘This is going to be extremely tough, and many of my clients can’t handle it.  But the law allows you to remain in your apartment during the proceedings.  If you stay in the house with her, our one bargaining chip will be her desire to get you out of the house.’” (2/4)","2015-10-26T18:55:01+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1115866375154128/?type=3","102099916530784_1115866375154128",77019,3471,1798

Not long after he bought it, the price of gold took a sharp fall.  My father called me from the store one day, and told me that he’d found a man who was going to buy the gold for last week’s price.  He wanted me to get the bar from his bedroom and bring it to him.

I told the judge: ‘I didn’t do it, but I’m pleading guilty.’  The judge said: ‘If you’re pleading guilty, you did it.’  I did the time, and now a few years later, I’m working a full time job, and my baby’s mother is on trial for robbing a store.  But it’s not like I can go back in time and wave that in the judge’s face.  Every time my daughter comes to visit, she starts crying and begs me not to send her back home.

But they don’t want to be protected.  I just hope that every student at my school can find one or two adults that they relate to.  And that's going to be a different teacher for every student.

""It all started when I was walking with my dad down a street in midtown.  A man, Brandon (an amazing photographer) met me, took our picture and I told him what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I said I wanted to be a reporter and that my dream would be to interview the head of NASA.  And then NASA responded, how amazing is that?  NASA then invited me to interview the administrator today and I learned so much but I’m going to focus on a few things.  First of all, I learned that in 2030 we will be on mars!  Next, Administrator Bolden (a very nice man) told me that 90% of the film “The Martian“ is real except the size of the dust storm because the atmosphere is too dense.  After the interview, we went to the NASA Headquarters Space Operations Center, where I watched the sunrise live from the space station – they see it 16 times a day.

I started studying fashion at the Art Institute.  I was invited to show at Fashion Week in South Africa.  I won an award for emerging designers.  Then right before graduation, the greatest thing of all happened.  I got an email from my favorite actress’s stylist.  You have to understand how much I loved this actress.  I used to daydream about being her best friend.  She was my inspiration.  She was the model I used for all my sketches.  And now she wanted to wear one of my dresses during a trip to Kenya!  The stylist requested that I send ten samples to choose from.  I borrowed $5,000 to make the dresses.  I worked for weeks.  I couldn’t sleep.  I even skipped my final portfolio presentation to deliver the samples.  I told everyone: my friends, my professors, and even the president of my school.  Everyone hugged me and said: ‘We aren’t surprised.  You have so much talent.  You were meant for greatness!’  Over the next few weeks, I refreshed the actress’s website all day long, waiting to see my dress.”","2015-11-27T20:02:00+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1136828713057894/?type=3","102099916530784_1136828713057894",83619,1944,1433

I was so embarrassed.  I felt like a failure.  I got so depressed that I had to move out of the city for a few months and live with my sister in Maryland.  I’ve been doing a lot of praying and going to church.  And I feel at peace now.  I think that God knew I wasn’t ready for success.  If my career had taken off then, I’d have thought it was from my own strength.  I was feeling too proud.  I needed to remember where my talent came from.  I’ve been praying so much.  And I’m in a good place now.  I’m ready to start moving forward again.  And it’s really unbelievable that I just ran into you.  Because I just came into the city for the afternoon to buy some fabric.”

He'd tried to slit his wrists a few months earlier.  And a month before that he tried to overdose on sleeping pills.  It wasn’t anyone’s fault.  My parents did everything they could.  They tried taking him to therapy, taking him to church, giving him all the medications that the doctor prescribed.  But nothing worked.  He was always angry.  When I came home from school that day, Mom and Dad were holding each other and promising that they wouldn’t let this tear them apart.  And I’ve spent the last three years of my life trying to help them hold their relationship together.  I always had to make sure Mom got out of bed.  I’d constantly remind her that she wasn’t a failure.  I’d tell her: ‘Look at me.  I’m doing great.  I’m still here.  Be with me.  Be with Dad.’  Now that I’ve finally moved away from home, I’m realizing that I spent all my time worrying about them.

And we were shopping together.  And cooking meals together.  It’s not like we were just going to the bar or watching sports.  These were real experiences we were sharing.  One night we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to watch the sunset.  And we sat on a rock.  And I kept casually touching him, and scooting toward him, but he’d always shirk away.  I wanted so bad for there to be something.  I’d tell myself that he just wasn’t sure of who he was.  But in reality, he just wasn’t interested.  I was too chicken to tell him how I felt.
